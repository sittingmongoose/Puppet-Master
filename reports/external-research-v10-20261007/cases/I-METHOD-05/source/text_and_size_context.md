### 2.5 Data model and dirty state

- **Buffer model:** One buffer per file path; one tab per path per group (no duplicate tabs for same path in one group). The active tab is the current buffer. See §2.4 for same path in multiple groups. ContractRef: Plans/storage-plan.md §2.3, Plans/FileSafe.md
- **Dirty state:** A buffer is dirty when in-memory content differs from last-saved content (not necessarily on-disk). UI shows unsaved indicator per tab when dirty.
- **Revert (reload from disk):** Revert reloads current buffer from disk. If buffer is dirty, prompt "Discard unsaved changes and reload?" (Discard / Cancel). After reload, dirty state is cleared.
- **Revert last agent edit:** See §2.2 for the contract (backend reverts, sends refresh notification; editor reloads buffer). FileSafe: Plans/FileSafe.md.
- **File changed on disk:** When the file on disk has changed since the buffer was loaded or last saved, the editor prompts the user. **When to check:** On **Save** (before overwriting: prompt Reload / Overwrite / Cancel) and when the **editor pane or the file's tab gains focus** (app-global: when the user focuses any editor window or switches to that tab). Do not check on every keystroke. **Dirty + file changed on disk:** If the buffer is dirty and the file changed on disk, show **one combined prompt** (e.g. "File changed on disk. You have unsaved changes. Reload (discard yours) / Overwrite disk / Cancel") so the user gets a single decision; do not show two separate dialogs in sequence.

### 2.6 Text behavior, encoding, and file types

- **Undo/redo:** Per-buffer undo and redo; no cross-file undo. Standard shortcuts (e.g. Ctrl+Z / Ctrl+Shift+Z or Ctrl+Y).
- **Selection and clipboard:** Copy, Cut, Paste (keyboard and context menu). Paste uses system clipboard. Optionally normalize line endings on paste.
- **Word wrap:** Off by default for code; optional toggle.
- **Font:** Monospace; size and family follow app theme or editor font setting.
- **Encoding:** UTF-8 for editable text. If file cannot be decoded as UTF-8, open read-only with a clear message (e.g. "Cannot decode as UTF-8") and do not allow editing until the file is valid UTF-8 (e.g. user fixes externally and reverts).
- **Line endings:** Preserve on save (keep CRLF/LF/CR).
- **When content is written:** Only on explicit Save; no auto-save in MVP.
- **Binary files:** Read-only with a clear reason: e.g. "Binary file -- cannot edit." Hex view out of scope for MVP.
- **Read-only files:** OS or Git read-only: show read-only indicator and **reason** (e.g. "Read-only on disk"); block Save; Save As allowed. **Read-only reason in UI:** Whenever a file is read-only, the UI must indicate **why**: e.g. "Binary file", "File too large", "Read-only on disk", "Cannot decode as UTF-8" (§2.7), so users are not confused.

### 2.7 Large files


- **Strategy (MVP):** Use **truncated view + "Load full file"** for files above the threshold. Open read-only with a truncated view (e.g. first N lines) and a "Load full file" control; if the user loads full, allow editing subject to the hard cap. Do not implement read-only virtualized editing in MVP unless needed.
- **Default threshold:** **10 000 lines** (primary metric for editor UX). Files above this are not loaded into an editable buffer by default; show truncated read-only view and "Load full file."
- **Hard cap:** Never load more than **5 MB** into a single buffer. Above 5 MB, show "File too large to edit" and offer "View read-only (truncated)" or "Open in system editor." Configurable in Settings → Editor: **Large file threshold (lines)** (e.g. 5k-50k) and **Hard cap (MB)** (e.g. 2-10); persist in redb.
