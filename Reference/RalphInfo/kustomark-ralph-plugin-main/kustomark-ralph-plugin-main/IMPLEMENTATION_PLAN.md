  - Shows patch details before each application
  - Diff preview shows what patch would change
  - Summary at end shows applied, skipped, and remaining patches
  - Forces sequential file processing in debug mode
- [x] Incremental builds
  - `--incremental` flag for build command
  - Build manifest (.kustomark.manifest.yaml) tracks file hashes
  - Detects config/patches changes for full rebuild
  - Only rebuilds files whose source content has changed
  - Tracks new, modified, and deleted files
  - SHA256 hashing for change detection
  - Unit tests for manifest and change analysis
- [x] Build cache

  - Position finding for accurate error locations
- [x] Web UI
  - `kustomark ui [path]` command to start web-based visual editor
