# Task: Task Management REST API

## Overview

Build a simple but production-ready REST API for managing tasks (todo items). The API should follow REST conventions and include proper error handling, validation, and documentation.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

1. **Create Task** - POST /tasks
   - Accept title (required), description (optional), due_date (optional)
   - Return created task with generated ID

2. **List Tasks** - GET /tasks
   - Return all tasks
   - Support filtering by status (pending/completed)
   - Support pagination (limit/offset)

3. **Get Task** - GET /tasks/:id
   - Return single task by ID
   - Return 404 if not found

4. **Update Task** - PUT /tasks/:id
   - Update any task fields
   - Return updated task
   - Return 404 if not found

5. **Delete Task** - DELETE /tasks/:id
   - Remove task
   - Return 204 on success
   - Return 404 if not found

6. **Complete Task** - PATCH /tasks/:id/complete
   - Mark task as completed
   - Set completed_at timestamp

### Non-Functional Requirements

- Response time < 100ms for all endpoints
- Proper HTTP status codes
- JSON error responses with meaningful messages
- Request logging

## Constraints

- Use TypeScript
- Use Express.js framework
- Use SQLite for storage (file-based, no external DB needed)
- Follow REST conventions
- No authentication required (keep it simple)

## Success Criteria

The task is complete when ALL of the following are true:

1. [ ] `npm start` runs the server without errors
2. [ ] POST /tasks implemented (validation + tests)
3. [ ] GET /tasks implemented (pagination/filtering + tests)
4. [ ] GET /tasks/:id implemented (404 + tests)
5. [ ] PUT /tasks/:id implemented (validation + 404 + tests)
6. [ ] PATCH /tasks/:id/complete implemented (tests)
7. [ ] DELETE /tasks/:id implemented (404 + tests)
8. [ ] Test coverage > 80% (run `npm test -- --coverage`)
9. [ ] README.md documents all endpoints with examples

## Technical Notes

Suggested project structure:
```
src/
  index.ts        # Entry point
  routes/
    tasks.ts      # Task routes
  models/
    task.ts       # Task model/schema
  db/
    sqlite.ts     # Database setup
  middleware/
    validation.ts # Input validation
tests/
  tasks.test.ts   # API tests
```

## Example Requests

```bash
# Create task
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/tasks \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"title": "Buy groceries", "description": "Milk, eggs, bread"}'

# List tasks
curl http://localhost:3000/tasks

# Get task
curl http://localhost:3000/tasks/1

# Update task
curl -X PUT http://localhost:3000/tasks/1 \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"title": "Buy groceries", "description": "Milk, eggs, bread, cheese"}'

# Complete task
curl -X PATCH http://localhost:3000/tasks/1/complete

# Delete task
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:3000/tasks/1
```

## Ralph Instructions

When working on this task:

1. Read `.ralph/progress.md` to see what's been done
2. Check `.ralph/guardrails.md` for signs to follow
3. Work on the next incomplete criterion from the checklist above
4. Update `.ralph/progress.md` with your progress
5. Commit your changes with descriptive messages
6. Run tests frequently to verify progress
7. When ALL criteria are met (all `[ ]` → `[x]`), output: `<ralph>COMPLETE</ralph>`
8. If stuck on the same issue 3+ times, output: `<ralph>GUTTER</ralph>`
