# Puppet Master Rewrite Tie-In Contract (Active)

> **Compliance:** This document follows `Plans/DRY_Rules.md` and references SSOT contracts in `Plans/Contracts_V0.md`. Naming: “Puppet Master” only. No open questions; deterministic defaults per `Plans/Decision_Policy.md`.


> This document exists to keep the rest of `Plans/` consistent as the rewrite is implemented.
> It records locked architectural decisions and the required implementation contracts for existing plans.

## Provided memo (verbatim)

This project is moving to a single, deterministic "agent loop" architecture where every backend is just a **Provider** behind one unified session/event store, tool registry, and patch/edit pipeline (so CLI-bridged providers don't become special-case chaos). This is intentionally adapting much of **OpenCode's architecture** (provider abstraction, centralized config, session orchestration, tool registry) to address current pain points and make the main engine deterministic and reliable. [web:7][web:11][web:69][web:71]

### What's changing (high level)
- **GUI rewrite:** Desktop UI is switching to Rust + Slint, with Slint's cross-platform **winit backend** for Windows/macOS/Linux. [web:149]
- **Renderer decision (locked):** default is **winit + Skia**, fallback GPU is **winit + FemtoVG-wgpu**, and we keep an emergency software fallback for compatibility; selection can be controlled via Slint's backend selection mechanisms (e.g., `BackendSelector` and/or `SLINT_BACKEND`). [web:48][web:149]
- **Theme behavior (locked):** theme switching will be supported, but it's acceptable to require an app **restart**; we will offer both a "Puppet Master default" look and a "Basic theme."
- **Storage rewrite (no SQLite):** storage becomes a multi-store design: `seglog` as the canonical append-only event ledger, `redb` for durable KV state/projections/settings, and Tantivy for full-text search over chats/docs/log summaries. [web:88][web:90][web:82]
- **Search & dashboards:** "fast search for humans + AI" is implemented via Tantivy indexes built from projected events/messages, while heavy analytics scans run off the append-only seglog stream and store rollups into redb. [web:82][web:88][web:90]

### The core reliability plan (what other features must align with)
- The system must be reproducible: sessions/runs are replayable from a canonical event stream (seglog), with deterministic projections into redb/Tantivy and checkpointing for resumability after crashes. [web:88][web:90][web:82]
- Tools are governed by a central policy engine (permissions + validation + normalized tool results), and edits go through an explicit patch/apply/verify/rollback pipeline (often using worktrees/branches/sandboxes) to prevent "silent corruption." (This mirrors the discipline implied by OpenCode-style tool/session separation.) [web:71][web:69]
- The "Plans/" documentation set is intended to be treated as the authoritative requirements source for orchestration states, safe-edit rules, subagents, worktree/git edge cases, and tooling behavior (so implementation doesn't drift via ad-hoc UI wiring). (This is a project governance rule, not a library detail.)
- **Resume semantics (rewrite-level):** resumability means Puppet Master restarts from the last durable safe boundary recorded in canonical storage/projector state. It does not imply provider-process or transport-session reattachment.
- **SSOT routing:** replay/checkpoint/rebuild semantics are owned by `Plans/storage-plan.md`; normalized provider-stream behavior is owned by `Plans/CLI_Bridged_Providers.md`; centralized tool-policy/result normalization is owned by `Plans/Tools.md`.

### Provider + CLI integrations (what's being hardened)
- **Claude Code CLI** is integrated as a Provider using the official CLI's machine-readable streaming mode (`--output-format stream-json`, print mode `-p`, optional partials via `--include-partial-messages`) and uses **Claude Code Hooks** (e.g., `PreToolUse`, `PostToolUse`) to gate tools and enrich telemetry. [page:3]
- **Cursor Agent CLI** is integrated as a Provider using `--print --output-format stream-json` (NDJSON stream) and internal parsing into the unified event model. [web:157]
- **ACP note (important):** Cursor CLI is not ACP-native as of a Cursor staff reply (2026-01-04); Cursor CLI supports MCPs and may add ACP later, so if ACP is needed it's via an adapter layer on our side (not because Cursor suddenly "speaks ACP"). [web:167]

### Gemini auth decision (locked)
- Gemini provider defaults to **API key** auth in the UI. This is an explicit allowed exception to the broader "subscription auth only / avoid API keys" guidance because Gemini's API key path can be used to access the user's Gemini subscription. OAuth remains optional as a stricter-access fallback. [page:4]

### Future mobile/web clients (impacts architecture now)
- Mobile/web clients will be "thin" and connect back to the desktop app (desktop acts like a local server), so the stable boundary is the unified event model + streaming API (runs/events/artifacts) and command API (start run, approve tool, cancel run), rather than direct access to providers/tools on mobile/web.
- Thin clients MUST NOT call providers, tool executors, or local patch pipelines directly. They consume streamed events/artifacts and send command requests to the desktop-owned core only.

### Implementation directives (required now)
- Implement features against the locked interfaces: **unified event model**, **Provider trait**, **tool registry**, and **event-sourced session store** (seglog -> projections). [web:69][web:88][web:90]
- UI updates must flow through the Slint event loop boundary and must not rely on delayed or ad-hoc polling paths.
- New plan text and implementation notes must use **Provider** terminology for execution integration; do not introduce new platform-runner phrasing in updated sections.
- Persistence and search paths must use seglog/redb/Tantivy contracts directly; do not add SQLite-based alternatives in edited sections.
- The Slint rewrite MUST remove all per-platform experimental settings: Settings > Advanced MUST NOT include an "Experimental features" section or per-platform "Enable Codex/Gemini/Copilot Experimental" toggles, config schemas MUST NOT include per-platform `experimentalEnabled` (or equivalent) keys, and provider invocations MUST NOT rely on provider-side experimental toggles (e.g., Copilot `--experimental` CLI flag, or legacy Gemini experimental settings) for runtime behavior. DirectApi providers (Codex, Copilot, Gemini) MUST expose only stable capabilities through their APIs, and CliBridge providers (Cursor, Claude Code) MUST NOT grow experimental toggles in the GUI or config.
  ContractRef: ContractName:Plans/CLI_Bridged_Providers.md, ContractName:Plans/FinalGUISpec.md
- Assistant memory is an Assistant-only continuity capability and MUST NOT alter Provider spine contracts, unified event model ownership, or shared rules pipeline semantics; implementation is specified in `Plans/assistant-memory-subsystem.md`.
  Note: Gist generation is artifact-driven (AutoRunBoundary/AutoMilestone) and remains Assistant-only; it does not change system SSOT ownership.

## Impacts on existing Plans (deltas to keep consistency)

### Immediate contradictions to resolve in Plans (so requirements do not fight each other)
- **UI tech:** any plan text that assumes **Iced** UI implementation should be treated as *UX requirements only*, not a widget/library implementation commitment
<a id="ui-scaling-migration"></a>
- **UI scaling migration:** Iced custom scaling mechanics (for example token-by-token multiplication layers) MUST be treated as legacy implementation references; Slint-target sections MUST describe native Slint scaling paths.
  ContractRef: ContractName:Plans/Contracts_V0.md#8
- **Storage:** any plan that proposes **SQLite** for run/session/history storage needs to be reframed as **event-sourced** storage with seglog/redb/Tantivy projections
- **Provider abstraction:** platform-specific execution terminology in touched sections must use **Provider** + unified event model, especially for streaming output and tool gating
- **Gemini auth:** existing "subscription-only / no API keys" guidance must explicitly allow a Gemini exception: "no API keys **except Gemini** (Gemini API key can represent subscription access)"
- **Automation references:** any mention of Iced-era automation must be treated as a **migration reference pattern only**; rewrite deliverables target Slint runtime contracts and shared evidence schema


### Storage consistency
- All run/session/artifact/checkpoint persistence and event emission must align with **Plans/storage-plan.md** (seglog writer, redb schema, projector pipeline, analytics scan).
- When adding or editing plans that touch runs, sessions, settings, or artifacts, add a cross-reference to storage-plan.md and specify whether the plan assumes seglog events, redb tables, or both.
- **Plans/storage-plan.md** -- Canonical storage checklist (seglog, redb schema, projectors, analytics); other plans that persist state or emit events should reference it and call out seglog vs redb.

### Plans likely needing the most rewrite-aware edits
- `Plans/newfeatures.md`
  - Already calls out "single Rust/Iced process" and rejects a three-process architecture; should be updated to "single core agent loop + Slint UI" and ensure streaming parsing is in-provider and normalized into the unified event model
- `Plans/assistant-chat-design.md`
  - Keep UX modes/permissions, but re-anchor persistence/search assumptions to seglog/redb/Tantivy and to the unified event stream
- `Plans/orchestrator-subagent-integration.md`
  - Treat tier/subagent strategy as "orchestrator policy" sitting above Providers; streaming output parsing and tool gating should be defined once at provider/tool-registry level, not per-platform
- `Plans/usage-feature.md`
  - Recast "usage ledger" as projections/rollups over the seglog stream, with indexes in Tantivy (search) and aggregates in redb
- `Plans/newtools.md`
  - Align MCP/tool discovery and Doctor checks with the central tool registry/policy engine (no per-provider special casing)
  - Carry Preview/Build/Docker/GitHub Actions contracts as Slint-target requirements and keep legacy Iced automation references migration-only

### Plans that are still conceptually valid (but should be reworded)
- `Plans/FileSafe.md`
  - Safety/policy intent remains valid; implementation should target patch/apply/verify/rollback and centralized tool governance rather than UI-level/file-manager specifics
- `Plans/WorktreeGitImprovement.md`, `Plans/MiscPlan.md`
  - Worktree/cleanup correctness stays valid; hook/crew sections should point to a single shared lifecycle framework in the new agent-loop core

## Suggested "single source of truth" rule for the rewrite

- Provider contracts, unified event model, tool registry, and patch pipeline should be specified in one canonical plan (or one canonical spec section), and other plans should reference it instead of re-describing it
