# Widget System -- Cross-Cutting Specification

## Fidelity recovery addendum

This addendum is an ordered parent-writer recovery container. It preserves the row-level fidelity repairs below without requiring multiple same-anchor packet writes.

### Fidelity recovery cov-048: Progress-only widget hostability
- Coverage rows: cov-048
- Fidelity gap refs: cov-048
- Required fidelity items:
- Exact required item: Restrict widget-composed Orchestrator surface to Progress
- Exact required item: Persist orchestrator:progress layout separately from Dashboard and Usage
- Acceptance checks represented:
- Exact acceptance check: The heading `### Fidelity recovery cov-048: Progress-only widget hostability` exists in `Plans/Widget_System.md`.
- Exact acceptance check: The `cov-048` repair states the exact requirement: Restrict widget-composed Orchestrator surface to Progress
- Exact acceptance check: The `cov-048` repair states the exact requirement: Persist orchestrator:progress layout separately from Dashboard and Usage
- Exact acceptance check: The `cov-048` repair includes an explicit consumer cross-reference to the owning canonical contract for the same requirement.

## 1. Scope and non-scope
Widget composition remains important, but it is no longer a blanket page-model for every major surface.

In scope:
- Dashboard widgets
- Usage widgets
- Orchestrator `Progress` widgets

Not in scope:
- `Seams` as a widget canvas
- `Node Graph` as a widget canvas
- `Evidence` as a widget canvas
- `History` as a widget canvas
- `Ledger` as a widget canvas

ContractRef: ContractName:Plans/Orchestrator_Page.md, ContractName:Plans/FinalGUISpec.md, ContractName:Plans/Crosswalk.md

## 2. Hostability and data contracts
Widgets consume stable projections and canonical records. They do not define page semantics.

Rules:
- widget config changes presentation, local filtering, and layout only
- widget-level filters inherit page/project/focused-run context and do not invent independent run scope
- a widget action routes through canonical commands and route/open contracts rather than bypassing them

ContractRef: ContractName:Plans/storage-plan.md, ContractName:Plans/UI_Command_Catalog.md, ContractName:Plans/Contracts_V0.md

## 3. Layout persistence
Layout persistence uses app-default with project override.

Rules:
- the default layout key remains stable per page/surface
- project-specific overrides may diverge from the app default
- run-level layout persistence is not canonical for Orchestrator `Progress`
- migration from legacy `dashboard_layout:v1` must retire stale orchestration-hostability assumptions rather than preserve them as peer canon

ContractRef: ContractName:Plans/FinalGUISpec.md, ContractName:Plans/Decision_Policy.md, ContractName:Plans/Orchestrator_Page.md

## 4. Orchestrator Progress widget scope and catalog linkage

Only the Orchestrator `Progress` surface is widget-composed. `Seams`, `Node Graph`, `Evidence`, `History`, and `Ledger` remain native views, and no other Orchestrator tab may opt into widget composition.

The Orchestrator UI composes exactly one consumer widget: the `Progress` widget with ID `widget-orchestrator-progress`. This widget occupies a dedicated layout space within the Orchestrator UI and receives orchestrator-native runtime events, progress markers, and node-level state.

`orchestrator:progress` persists in its own layout namespace and does not share layout keys with Dashboard or Usage. Layout resets, imports, and overrides for Dashboard or Usage do not rewrite Orchestrator Progress placement.

### Catalog source and drill linkage

The Progress widget ID (`widget-orchestrator-progress`) is defined in the current promoted widget catalog in `Plans/FinalGUISpec.md` Appendix C (§ C.2, § C.4). Widget_System consumes that named catalog source directly and does not invent an independent catalog or additional widget cards.

The full 13-widget Progress catalog and default drill targets are:
1. `progress.run-overview` → Execution unit tree scoped to `focused_run_id`
2. `progress.current-task` → Node inspector for the active execution unit
3. `progress.lane-health` → Lane row filtered to the selected lane or worktree
4. `progress.node-throughput` → Dense node list filtered to slow or blocked nodes
5. `progress.blocked-concerns` → Concern lane filtered to `blocked` or `attention_required`
6. `progress.approval-queue` → Concern inspector showing pending approvals
7. `progress.recovery-status` → Recovery timeline for the selected concern or blocked episode
8. `progress.artifact-receipts` → Artifact browser filtered to receipt-linked runtime artifacts
9. `progress.worktree-state` → Source Control worktree row with lane, package, and run refs
10. `progress.account-pressure` → Historical `account_pressure_episode` list
11. `progress.account-switches` → Historical `account_switch_event` list
12. `progress.escalation-stack` → Project attention view focused on the shared escalation ladder
13. `progress.attention-summary` → `project_attention_item.primary_route_payload` list

Drill-through and linkage semantics (`progress` → node, `progress` → lane, `progress` → evidence) are owned by the Orchestrator UI and by the FinalGUISpec consumer contract, not by Widget_System hostability rules.

Transferred Progress labels and taxonomy:
- State labels: `queued`, `running`, `attention_required`, `blocked`, `recovering`, `degraded`, `complete`
- Action labels: `Inspect`, `Focus run`, `Open evidence`, `Request approval`, `Acknowledge`, `Dismiss`, `Resolve`, `Retry recovery`
- Alert taxonomy: `advisory`, `attention_required`, `blocked`, `escalated`, `degraded_projection`
- Event taxonomy: `run_started`, `node_started`, `node_completed`, `concern_opened`, `approval_requested`, `approval_decided`, `recovery_started`, `recovery_completed`, `artifact_published`, `account_switched`
- Condition-aging policy: advisory warnings may quiet after one stable refresh window; `attention_required` resurfaces on meaningful change or persistence; `blocked` and `escalated` never auto-quiet
