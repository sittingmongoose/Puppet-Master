# Decision Policy (Canonical)

<!--
PUPPET MASTER -- DETERMINISTIC DECISION POLICY

Goal: remove deferred-decision ambiguity by defining deterministic defaults.

ABSOLUTE NAMING RULE:
- Platform name is "Puppet Master" only.
- If older naming exists, refer to it only as "legacy naming" (do not quote it).
-->

## 0. Scope
This policy applies whenever a plan or implementation encounters an ambiguity that is not resolved by Spec Lock, Crosswalk, DRY Rules, or Glossary.

ContractRef: PolicyRule:Decision_Policy.md

---

## 1. Precedence (non-negotiable)
Resolve ambiguity in this order:
1. `Plans/Spec_Lock.json`
2. `Plans/Crosswalk.md`
3. `Plans/DRY_Rules.md`
4. `Plans/Glossary.md`
5. This policy

ContractRef: SchemaID:Spec_Lock.json

## 2. Deterministic defaults (must be autonomous)
When multiple valid choices exist and higher-precedence sources do not decide:

1) **Prefer the simplest safe default** that does not expand scope.
   - Example: choose a single host (GitHub.com) rather than adding multi-host abstractions.

2) **Prefer API-only over CLI subprocesses** when both are possible and Spec Lock forbids the CLI.

3) **Prefer idempotent behavior**.
   - If an operation can be repeated safely, implement it as idempotent (no double-side-effects).

4) **Prefer bounded retries**.
   - Retries MUST have explicit limits and backoff.
   ContractRef: PolicyRule:Decision_Policy.md§2

5) **Prefer stable IDs over inferred labels**.
    - UI commands use `cmd.*` IDs; event types use stable `type` strings.

6) **Prefer redaction**.
   - If data might be a secret, treat it as a secret and do not persist it.

ContractRef: Invariant:INV-002, SchemaID:Spec_Lock.json#github_operations

---

## 3. Tie-break rules (ordering)
If two choices are otherwise equal:
- Choose the option that is already referenced by an existing plan document.
- If still tied, choose lexicographically smallest stable ID.

ContractRef: PolicyRule:Decision_Policy.md§2

---

## 4. "No human in the loop" rule
Plans MUST NOT depend on humans making decisions mid-run.
If a plan describes optionality, it MUST declare a deterministic default and cite this policy.

ContractRef: PolicyRule:Decision_Policy.md§2

## 5. SpecLock Update Protocol (autonomous; no human readers)

**Rule:** `Plans/Spec_Lock.json` is a lockfile; agents MUST only update it via this protocol and MUST proceed deterministically (no interactive human-decision pauses, no decision logs).  
ContractRef: SchemaID:Spec_Lock.json, PolicyRule:Decision_Policy.md§2

### 5.1 When Spec Lock updates are allowed
Spec Lock updates are allowed only when at least one locked invariant/decision must change to satisfy a higher-level requirement (e.g., a new official toolkit version, a required auth scope change).  
ContractRef: SchemaID:Spec_Lock.json

### 5.2 Required steps (deterministic)
When an update is required, agents MUST:
1. Update `Plans/Spec_Lock.json` fields (no partial updates).  
   ContractRef: SchemaID:Spec_Lock.json, PolicyRule:Decision_Policy.md#spec-lock-update-protocol
2. Recompute and update `canonical_ssot_hashes[*].sha256` for every SSOT file listed in Spec Lock.  
   ContractRef: SchemaID:Spec_Lock.json#canonical_ssot_hashes
3. Append one JSONL row to `Plans/auto_decisions.jsonl` describing the change and its deterministic rationale.  
   ContractRef: SchemaID:auto_decisions.schema.json, PolicyRule:Decision_Policy.md#spec-lock-update-protocol
4. Produce an evidence bundle for the update (schema-valid) and run the verifier gates.  
   ContractRef: SchemaID:evidence.schema.json, Gate:GATE-001, PolicyRule:Decision_Policy.md#spec-lock-update-protocol

### 5.3 Prohibited update behaviors
Agents MUST NOT:
- add `TBD` / `Open Questions` / `ask later` language as part of a Spec Lock update  
  ContractRef: ContractName:Plans/DRY_Rules.md#4
- leave hashes stale after changing SSOT docs  
  ContractRef: SchemaID:Spec_Lock.json#canonical_ssot_hashes

### PolicyRule: no_secrets_in_storage

**Scope:** All persistent stores (seglog, redb, Tantivy indexes).

**Rule:** Persistent stores MUST NOT contain secrets (tokens, passwords, API keys, OAuth refresh tokens). Tokens live only in the OS credential store (platform keyring). Violations are P0 bugs requiring immediate remediation.

**Rationale:** Secrets in persistent stores risk exfiltration via backup, log export, or crash dump. The OS credential store provides encrypted, access-controlled storage.

**Cross-references:**
- Architecture_Invariants.md#INV-002
- Crosswalk.md §3.5 (SessionStore rules)
- Crosswalk.md §3.6 (AuthState rules: "Tokens MUST NOT be persisted in AuthState")
