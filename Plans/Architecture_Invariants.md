# Architecture Invariants (Canonical)

> **Compliance:** This document follows `Plans/DRY_Rules.md` and references SSOT contracts in `Plans/Contracts_V0.md`. Naming: “Puppet Master” only. No open questions; deterministic defaults per `Plans/Decision_Policy.md`.


<!--
PUPPET MASTER -- ARCHITECTURE INVARIANTS

ABSOLUTE NAMING RULE:
- Platform name is "Puppet Master" only.
- If older naming exists, refer to it only as "legacy naming" (do not quote it).
-->

## 0. Scope
Invariants are cross-cutting rules that MUST hold across all plans and implementations.

ContractRef: Primitive:Invariant, PolicyRule:Decision_Policy.md§1

<a id="INV-001"></a>
## INV-001 -- Tool correlation integrity (normalized streams + persisted events)
**Rule:** Tool invocation correlation MUST be consistent:
- In normalized provider streams, every `tool_use` MUST have exactly one matching `tool_result` with the same `tool_use_id` (no orphan tool events).  
  ContractRef: ContractName:Plans/CLI_Bridged_Providers.md
- In persisted event streams, tool activity MUST be represented using the canonical tool event types (`tool.invoked`, `tool.denied`) and MUST include stable `run_id` + `thread_id` correlation.  
  ContractRef: ContractName:Contracts_V0.md

---

<a id="INV-002"></a>
## INV-002 -- No secrets in persistent storage

**Rule:** Secrets (tokens, credentials, private keys) MUST NOT be written to:
- seglog event stream
- redb projections
- Tantivy indexes
- sparse n-gram regex-index artifacts (`frequency_table.bin`, `postings.bin`, `lookup.bin`, `file_map.bin`, `index_meta.json`) except for secrets-scrubbed derived content and project-relative paths
- plaintext logs, evidence bundles, or state files

**Allowed persistence:** OS credential store only.

ContractRef: SchemaID:Spec_Lock.json#locked_decisions.storage, SchemaID:evidence.schema.json, PolicyRule:no_secrets_in_storage, ContractName:Plans/Tools.md, ContractName:Plans/storage-plan.md

## INV-003 -- UI SSOT (no bespoke UI behavior)
**Rule:** UI copy, buttons, and view behavior MUST be specified in the canonical UI SSOT docs and typed command layer; plan docs may reserve IDs but must not invent ad-hoc UI behaviors.

ContractRef: Primitive:UICommand, ContractName:Contracts_V0.md#UICommand

---

<a id="INV-004"></a>
## INV-004 -- UI command boundary (no business logic in UI)
**Rule:** The UI layer MUST dispatch stable `UICommand` IDs and MUST NOT execute business logic directly.

ContractRef: Primitive:UICommand, ContractName:Contracts_V0.md#UICommand, ContractName:Plans/UI_Command_Catalog.md

---

<a id="INV-005"></a>
## INV-005 -- Deterministic ordering from SSOT lists
**Rule:** When multiple candidates exist (paths, names, servers, etc.), tie-break ordering MUST come from a single SSOT list owned by the relevant domain; no heuristic reordering.

ContractRef: Primitive:Provider, ContractName:Plans/CLI_Bridged_Providers.md

---

<a id="INV-006"></a>
## INV-006 -- Providers are storage-isolated

**Rule:** Providers and provider adapters MUST NOT write directly to persistent storage (`seglog`, `redb`, `Tantivy`, sparse n-gram index files, or remote-cache state). They emit normalized events or tool results; PM-owned storage writers, projectors, and cache managers own persistence.

ContractRef: Primitive:Provider, Primitive:SessionStore, ContractName:Plans/Crosswalk.md, ContractName:Plans/storage-plan.md

## INV-007 -- No stringly-typed IDs outside SSOT
**Rule:** Stable IDs (Tool IDs, UICommand IDs, ConfigKey names, schema IDs) MUST NOT be re-invented as ad-hoc string literals in multiple places. They must be defined once (SSOT) and referenced everywhere else.

ContractRef: Primitive:DRYRules, ContractName:Plans/DRY_Rules.md

---

<a id="INV-008"></a>
## INV-008 -- GitHub operations are API-only
**Rule:** GitHub hosting/auth/repo/fork/PR operations MUST use the GitHub HTTPS API only; the GitHub CLI (`gh`) MUST NOT be used for these operations.

ContractRef: SchemaID:Spec_Lock.json#locked_decisions.github_operations, ContractName:Plans/GitHub_API_Auth_and_Flows.md

---

<a id="INV-009"></a>
## INV-009 -- Cursor transport is invisible to consumers
**Rule:** Cursor must support both `stream-json` and ACP transports under one Provider facade; consumers MUST NOT branch on transport type.

ContractRef: SchemaID:Spec_Lock.json#locked_decisions.providers, ContractName:Plans/CLI_Bridged_Providers.md

---

<a id="INV-010"></a>
## INV-010 -- Platform naming compliance
**Rule:** The platform name is **Puppet Master** only.
Any older naming must be referred to only as **legacy naming** (without quoting the older name).

ContractRef: Primitive:Glossary

---

<a id="INV-011"></a>
## INV-011 -- UI command dispatch only (Rule 1)
**Rule:** The UI layer MUST dispatch only typed `UICommand` envelopes to trigger non-trivial behavior. The UI MUST NOT call backend services, storage, domain logic, or provider integrations directly. All user-initiated interactions flow through the UI Command Dispatcher boundary.

ContractRef: Primitive:UICommand, ContractName:Plans/UI_Wiring_Rules.md#section-1, ContractName:Plans/Contracts_V0.md#UICommand, ContractName:Plans/UI_Command_Catalog.md

---

<a id="INV-012"></a>
## INV-012 -- Wiring matrix coverage (Rule 2)

<a id="INV-013"></a>
## INV-013 -- Pre-dispatch tool validation

`policy.may_execute_tool()` MUST be called for every tool dispatch at every nesting depth regardless of invocation path. No child-run, plugin path, provider surface, or shell bridge may bypass this invariant.

ContractRef: ContractName:Plans/Permissions_System.md, ContractName:Plans/Tools.md

Enforcement may be static (import-graph / compile-time gate) or runtime (central dispatch gate), but direct calls to tool implementations without this permission gate are prohibited.

ContractRef: Invariant:INV-013, ContractName:Plans/Architecture_Invariants.md

## INV-014 -- Shared mutable state requires RWMutex

Any data structure shared across threads or async tasks that can be mutated MUST be protected by an `RwLock` (or equivalent). Lock-free approaches are allowed only when formally justified. Silent data races are prohibited.

ContractRef: ContractName:Plans/Executor_Protocol.md, ContractName:Plans/storage-plan.md

ContractRef: Invariant:INV-014

<a id="INV-015"></a>
## INV-015 -- Monetary values are integer microdollars

All persisted and in-memory monetary cost values MUST be stored as integer microdollars (`u64`). Float types MUST NOT be used for cost storage or accumulation at any layer. Display conversion to decimal happens only at the presentation layer.

ContractRef: ContractName:Plans/usage-feature.md, ContractName:Plans/Contracts_V0.md

Enforcement: `clippy` or custom lint to reject `f64`/`f32` fields named `cost*`, `price*`, or `amount*` in persisted structs.
ContractRef: Invariant:INV-015

<a id="INV-016"></a>
## INV-016 -- Token fields are never aggregated at storage layer

The five canonical token fields (`input_tokens`, `output_tokens`, `cache_read_input_tokens`, `cache_creation_input_tokens`, `reasoning_tokens`) MUST be stored individually in every usage record. Pre-aggregation or collapsing at the storage or event layer is prohibited.

ContractRef: ContractName:Plans/usage-feature.md, ContractName:Plans/Contracts_V0.md

ContractRef: Invariant:INV-016

<a id="INV-017"></a>
## INV-017 -- File mutations are atomic (temp-fsync-rename)

All FileSafe-managed file write operations MUST use the atomic write pattern: write to a temp file, fsync, rename to the target path. Direct `os.WriteFile` or equivalent non-atomic write calls MUST NOT be used for managed files.

ContractRef: ContractName:Plans/FileSafe.md, ContractName:Plans/storage-plan.md

ContractRef: Invariant:INV-017

<a id="INV-018"></a>
## INV-018 -- Seglog CRC32 is mandatory

Every seglog record MUST include a CRC32 checksum. Checksum validation MUST occur on every read. A record that fails CRC32 validation MUST be skipped and a recovery event emitted. Silently processing a corrupt record is prohibited.

ContractRef: ContractName:Plans/storage-plan.md, ContractName:Plans/Executor_Protocol.md

ContractRef: Invariant:INV-018

**Rule:** Every interactive UI element MUST map to exactly one `UICommandID`. The mapping MUST be recorded in the wiring matrix (validated by `Plans/Wiring_Matrix.schema.json`). Every `UICommandID` listed in `Plans/UI_Command_Catalog.md` MUST have a registered handler. No interactive element may exist without a wiring matrix entry; no catalog command may lack a handler.

ContractRef: Primitive:UICommand, ContractName:Plans/UI_Wiring_Rules.md#section-2, SchemaID:Wiring_Matrix.schema.json, Gate:GATE-010

---

## Contract-driven code generation (lightweight; DRY)
To avoid duplicated shapes for tools/events/policy:
- JSON Schemas under `Plans/*.schema.json` are the canonical source for validation and (optionally) code generation.  
  ContractRef: Primitive:DRYRules, ContractName:Plans/DRY_Rules.md
- Generated Rust code MUST live under a single `generated/` boundary (path is implementation-defined) and MUST NOT be hand-edited.  
  ContractRef: Primitive:Invariant, PolicyRule:Decision_Policy.md§2

---

## Validation (gated; autonomous)
Invariants are validated by progression gate `GATE-003`.

**Minimum automated checks (scriptable):**
- Validate schemas (plan graph, evidence, change budget, auto decisions).  
  ContractRef: Gate:GATE-001
- Enforce `INV-008` by scanning for GitHub CLI usage in build-governing docs and implementation surfaces.  
  ContractRef: Invariant:INV-008
- Enforce `INV-010` naming compliance in `Plans/` (platform name only).  
  ContractRef: Invariant:INV-010
- Enforce `INV-011` by verifying no UI code directly calls backend/storage/provider modules (static analysis or import-graph check).  
  ContractRef: Invariant:INV-011
- Enforce `INV-012` by validating wiring matrix coverage: every UICommandID in the catalog has a handler entry, and every interactive element has a wiring entry.  
  ContractRef: Invariant:INV-012, Gate:GATE-010

ContractRef: Gate:GATE-003

## Debug investigation invariants addendum (2026-03-23)

### Invariant A -- Debug overlay is not a runtime mode
`debug` MUST exist only in overlay identity and UI label state. The canonical runtime-mode enum remains `ask | plan | regular | yolo`.

ContractRef: ContractName:Plans/Run_Modes.md, ContractName:Plans/assistant-chat-design.md, ContractName:Plans/Contracts_V0.md

### Invariant B -- Visible evidence ingress only
Automatically collected Debug evidence MUST become visible Investigation Context or Runtime Artifacts state. PM MUST NOT rely on hidden prompt-only evidence injection for browser/debug payloads.

ContractRef: ContractName:Plans/assistant-chat-design.md, ContractName:Plans/storage-plan.md, ContractName:Plans/Prompt_Pipeline.md

### Invariant C -- Cross-surface investigation identity
Any PM surface that participates in debugging MUST preserve `investigation_id` and, when applicable, `instrumentation_id` rather than minting surface-local debug identities that cannot be correlated later.

ContractRef: ContractName:Plans/storage-plan.md, ContractName:Plans/Runtime_Artifacts_Panel.md, ContractName:Plans/orchestrator-subagent-integration.md

## INV-019 -- Runtime identity and blocked-policy continuity
**Rule:** Canonical runtime identity and blocked-state policy MUST survive dispatch, restart recovery, approval, and usage attribution without being reminted or collapsed into provider-native aliases.
- `execution_role`, `requested_account_id`, requested/effective operational identity, and account-switch lineage remain part of the shared runtime packet and every blocked/recovery handoff.
- `blocked_sequence` is the canonical blocked-episode anchor; startup recovery rebinds unresolved blocked episodes to the preserved runtime identity instead of minting a new episode.
- DAE jail posture, approval posture, usage switch-history, and execution-role follow-through remain continuous across retries, resumes, restores, and recovered attempts.

ContractRef: ContractName:Plans/Contracts_V0.md, ContractName:Plans/Executor_Protocol.md, ContractName:Plans/CLI_Bridged_Providers.md, ContractName:Plans/GitHub_API_Auth_and_Flows.md
