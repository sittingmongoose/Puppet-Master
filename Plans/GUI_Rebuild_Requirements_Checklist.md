# GUI Rebuild Requirements Checklist (2026-02-23)

> **Compliance:** This document follows `Plans/DRY_Rules.md` and references SSOT contracts in `Plans/Contracts_V0.md`. Naming: “Puppet Master” only. No open questions; deterministic defaults per `Plans/Decision_Policy.md`.


<!--
PUPPET MASTER -- GUI REBUILD CHECKLIST

ABSOLUTE NAMING RULE:
- Platform name is "Puppet Master" only.
- If older naming exists, refer to it only as "legacy naming" (do not quote it).
-->

## Purpose

This checklist is the single auditable summary that verifies the 2026-02-23 GUI rebuild handoff requirements are covered by canonical plan documents.

## Verification Table

| Area | Required canonical state | Verification status rule |
|---|---|---|
| Orchestrator tabs | `Progress`, `Seams`, `Node Graph`, `Evidence`, `History`, `Ledger` | Fail if `Tiers` remains canonical or if non-Progress tabs remain widget canvases |
| Widget hostability | Dashboard, Usage, and Orchestrator `Progress` only | Fail if `Seams`, `Node Graph`, `Evidence`, `History`, or `Ledger` are still treated as widgetized |
| Runtime approval identity | blocked-episode identity with `run_id`, `node_id`, `blocked_sequence`, `attempt_id?`, `allowed_action_ids[]` | Fail if `request_id`, `tier_id`, or `allowed_actions[]` remain primary |
| Runtime identity display | inherited/overridden, requested/effective, honored/skipped/clamped | Fail if compact or detailed surfaces collapse these states |
| Projection state | `projection_freshness` and `projection_health` | Fail if trust is still modeled as one overloaded field |
| Usage correlation | `usage_event_ref` and runtime attribution fields | Fail if Orchestrator/Graph/Usage still correlate primarily by `tier_id` |
| Source-open behavior | `route_target`, `OpenSubject`, `OpenFile` split | Fail if path-only open is still treated as universal |
| Source Control boundary | narrow worktree-first Source Control; operational lane/package/seam Orchestrator | Fail if Source Control becomes lane-first canon or Orchestrator duplicates raw worktree inventory |
| Graph lineage | graph patches create new generations and retain superseded visible paths | Fail if graph patching still rewrites in place conceptually |
| Concern model | first-class concern lifecycle and lineage | Fail if concerns remain buried in reviews/alerts only |

## Command Catalog Coverage Check

The following command groups introduced by the 2026-02-23 docs are now listed in the canonical command registry:

- `cmd.widget.*`
- `cmd.graph.*`
- `cmd.orchestrator.*`
- `cmd.orchestrator.preview_open`
- `cmd.orchestrator.preview_stop`
- `cmd.orchestrator.open_preview_artifact`
- `cmd.orchestrator.build_run`
- `cmd.orchestrator.open_build_artifact`
- `cmd.chat.compact_context`
- `cmd.chat.open_usage_popout`
- `cmd.chat.close_usage_popout`

REF: `Plans/UI_Command_Catalog.md` sections 2.3 through 2.6.

## Completion Criteria

This checklist is complete when all rows in the verification table are `PASS` and verifier gates pass.

## 2026-03-07 addendum — DockerHub / Unraid GUI requirements

| Requirement | Canonical expectation | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Source Control surface | Separate first-class Source Control surface with Changes, History, Graph, Worktrees, and Branches / Stash; not merged into GitHub Actions | `Plans/GitHub_Integration.md`, `Plans/WorktreeGitImprovement.md`, `Plans/FinalGUISpec.md` |
| GitHub Actions surface | Separate first-class GitHub Actions surface with Current Branch, Workflows, Settings, rerun/cancel/pin, and secrets/variables/environments CRUD | `Plans/GitHub_Integration.md`, `Plans/GitHub_API_Auth_and_Flows.md`, `Plans/newtools.md` |
| Docker Manager visibility | Contextual Docker Manager surface shown for Docker-related projects, with `Hide Docker Manage when not used in Project.` defaulting to enabled | `Plans/Containers_Registry_and_Unraid.md`, `Plans/FinalGUISpec.md` |
| Docker Manager breadth | Containers, images, compose, registries, build/bake, Publish / Unraid, networks/volumes/contexts, and project-focused Kubernetes | `Plans/Containers_Registry_and_Unraid.md`, `Plans/newtools.md` |
| DockerHub auth UX | Browser login plus PAT, requested-vs-effective capability display, and disabled-with-explanation controls when capability is partial | `Plans/Containers_Registry_and_Unraid.md`, `Plans/newtools.md` |
| Repo creation safety | Missing-repo creation is explicit, non-bypassable, and distinct from image-push approval | `Plans/Containers_Registry_and_Unraid.md`, `Plans/Permissions_System.md` |
| Orchestrator pivots | Orchestrator exposes `Open in Source Control`, `Open in GitHub Actions`, and `Open in Docker Manager` with preserved context | `Plans/Orchestrator_Page.md`, `Plans/UI_Command_Catalog.md` |
| Usage/Ledger linkage | cost-bearing receipts from these surfaces deep-link into canonical Usage/Ledger, not a feature-local cost view | `Plans/usage-feature.md`, `Plans/Runtime_Artifacts_Panel.md` |

## 2026-03-09 addendum — Artifacts panel and Usage/Ledger linkage
- [ ] Artifacts panel in view inventory and panel system (FinalGUISpec §7.1, §4.1, §5).
- [ ] Panel toggling: Git, Docker, Source Control, Unraid, Artifacts, Chat, Files (single side-panel slot, last-click wins).
- [ ] Usage/Ledger linkage from cost_usage artifact (Show in Ledger / Show in Usage actions).
