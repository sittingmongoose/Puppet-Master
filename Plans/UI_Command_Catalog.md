# UI Command Catalog (Canonical)

<!--
PUPPET MASTER -- UI COMMAND SSOT

ABSOLUTE NAMING RULE:
- Platform name is "Puppet Master" only.
- If older naming exists, refer to it only as "legacy naming" (do not quote it).
-->

## 0. Scope
This file is the SSOT list of stable UI command IDs.
Command IDs are referenced by plans and tests; implementations MUST treat these IDs as stable.

ContractRef: Primitive:UICommand, ContractName:Contracts_V0.md#UICommand

---

## 1. Naming rules
- IDs MUST be lowercase and dot-separated.
- Prefix MUST be `cmd.`.

ContractRef: Primitive:UICommand, ContractName:Contracts_V0.md#UICommand

## 2. Canonical command IDs

### 2.0 Command entry contract (doc-level)
Every command listed below MUST define:
- **Args schema (keys only)** — the `args` keys expected by the command handler
- **Expected events** — stable event types emitted as a result of the command
- **Affected surfaces** — which screens/panels are impacted (layout can change; command IDs do not)

ContractRef: ContractName:Contracts_V0.md#UICommand, ContractName:Contracts_V0.md#EventRecord

### 2.1 GitHub auth (GitHub HTTPS API only)

#### `cmd.github.connect`
Start GitHub OAuth device-code flow.

- **Args schema:** `{}` (no args; host/scope are locked by Spec Lock).  
  ContractRef: SchemaID:Spec_Lock.json#locked_decisions.github_operations, SchemaID:Spec_Lock.json#locked_decisions.auth_model
- **Expected events:** `auth.github.device_code.issued`, `auth.github.token.polling`, terminal: `auth.github.authenticated` or `auth.github.failed`.  
  ContractRef: ContractName:Plans/GitHub_API_Auth_and_Flows.md
- **Affected surfaces:** Settings > GitHub/Auth, Setup flow, Dashboard auth status.

ContractRef: UICommand:cmd.github.connect

#### `cmd.github.disconnect`
Disconnect and delete token (credential store).

- **Args schema:** `{}`  
  ContractRef: ContractName:Contracts_V0.md#AuthState
- **Expected events:** `auth.github.disconnected`.  
  ContractRef: ContractName:Plans/GitHub_API_Auth_and_Flows.md
- **Affected surfaces:** Settings > GitHub/Auth, Dashboard auth status.

ContractRef: UICommand:cmd.github.disconnect

ContractRef: UICommand:cmd.github.connect, UICommand:cmd.github.disconnect

---

### 2.2 LSP (minimum required)
These IDs are required by `Plans/LSPSupport.md`.

**Common args schema (keys only):**
- `path` (string)
- `position` (object): `{ line: number, character: number }` (0-based)

ContractRef: ContractName:Plans/Tools.md

**Expected events (minimum):**
- `tool.invoked` (tool_name = `lsp`) or `tool.denied` (if policy blocks).  
  ContractRef: ContractName:Contracts_V0.md

**Affected surfaces (minimum):** File editor, Problems panel, Chat (when LSP-in-chat is enabled).

#### Command IDs
- `cmd.lsp.goto_definition` — args: `{ path, position }`
- `cmd.lsp.find_references` — args: `{ path, position }`
- `cmd.lsp.rename_symbol` — args: `{ path, position, new_name }`
- `cmd.lsp.format_document` — args: `{ path }`
- `cmd.lsp.format_selection` — args: `{ path, range }`
- `cmd.lsp.code_action` — args: `{ path, range }`
- `cmd.lsp.goto_symbol` — args: `{ query }`
- `cmd.lsp.open_problems` — args: `{}`
- `cmd.lsp.restart_server` — args: `{ server_id? }`
