## Runtime Scheduler Packet Verification Canonical Alignment (2026-03-09)


Add verification checks for:
- canonical event-name precedence (`scheduler.pass` and related canonical names win over legacy aliases)
- no remaining primary lexical-dispatch wording in canonical executor/runtime sections
- graph-degradation fallback forbidden after `run.graph_canonical_locked`
- blocked outcomes remain distinct from failures in UI/projections
- permission/auth/approval/replan resolution emits same-cycle prerequisite wake behavior
- FileSafe restore-before-rerun override is honored when declared by blocked projections
