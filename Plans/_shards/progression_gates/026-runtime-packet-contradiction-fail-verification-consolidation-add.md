## Runtime Packet Contradiction-Fail Verification Consolidation Addendum (2026-03-09)

The packet verification gate MUST fail if any of the following remain true in primary or summary docs:
ContractRef: ContractName:Plans/Contracts_V0.md, ContractName:Plans/Executor_Protocol.md, ContractName:Plans/UI_Command_Catalog.md
- any canonical executor/runtime section still defines lexical ready-node selection as the active dispatch rule
- any runtime-facing doc uses `recovery_options[]` or `allowed_actions[]` as the canonical shared blocked payload field
- any runtime-facing doc models blocked reasons as `failure_class` values
- any queue-analysis event/command/artifact uses `analysis_id` as canonical identity instead of `scheduler_pass_id`
- any core wizard/thread/dashboard section still models `attention_required` as the only paused clarification state
- any recovery command table lacks exact canonical command ids for runtime action families
- any provider/auth/tool doc still authorizes hidden local retry loops after runtime classification exists
