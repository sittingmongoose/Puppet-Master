Phase 2B batches 111 and 112 atomized source spans `00-plans-index-S0001` through `00-plans-index-S0024` into fine-grained PlanUnits `0PI-002` through `0PI-054`, except for structural heading/container dispositions. `00-plans-index-S0007` is the Plan map heading, `00-plans-index-S0025` is the PlanUnits heading/container, and `00-plans-index-S0027` is Migration Coverage metadata. `00-plans-index-S0026` is the retired `0PI-001` bridge disposition. `0PI-001` is retired to migration-lineage compatibility only and no longer uses `source_preserving_planunit` compile mode. These batches did not update Spec Lock, generated shards, evidence bundles, auto_decisions, or plan_graph, and they did not create WorkNodes, NodeSeeds, executable queues, final node manifests, or production build tasks.
