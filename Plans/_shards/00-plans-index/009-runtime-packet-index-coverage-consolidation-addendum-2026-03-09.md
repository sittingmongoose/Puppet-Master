## Runtime Packet Index Coverage Consolidation Addendum (2026-03-09)


Update index descriptions so readers can find the owning docs for:
- scheduler semantics and queue analysis
- event/contracts and storage for attempts, safe points, and remediation lineage
- blocked-state UX and recovery actions
- provider/auth/permission mappings into runtime taxonomy
- glossary ownership for new runtime terms

Index descriptions for this packet MUST point readers to:
ContractRef: ContractName:Plans/Contracts_V0.md, ContractName:Plans/Executor_Protocol.md, ContractName:Plans/storage-plan.md, ContractName:Plans/Glossary.md
- `Plans/Contracts_V0.md` for canonical events, enums, identities, and action fields
- `Plans/Executor_Protocol.md` for scheduler semantics, attempt lifecycle, and graph-lock behavior
- `Plans/storage-plan.md` for persistence and restart rules
- `Plans/Run_Graph_View.md`, `Plans/Orchestrator_Page.md`, and `Plans/FinalGUISpec.md` for rendering and interaction
- `Plans/assistant-chat-design.md` and `Plans/interview-subagent-integration.md` for active paused/degraded planning-state semantics; `Plans/chain-wizard-flexibility.md` preserves legacy examples only as compatibility/source-lineage input
- `Plans/Glossary.md` for canonical runtime terminology
