## Known cross-cutting duplication hotspots


The highest-risk duplication hotspots for this planning set are now:

- child-run canon versus provider-native subagent language
- Persona selection versus subagent registry language
- crew shared-state versus legacy memory-manager language
- dynamic context shrinking versus compaction and Subcompact language
- requested/effective runtime surface and effort language
- blocked/awaiting-parent versus older denial or recovery aliases
- Context Lens UI wording versus command and wiring ownership

Rewrite-era guidance:
- owner docs define the canon.
- consumer docs should reference owner docs rather than re-describing the full model.
- packetization and reconciliation should prefer rewrite-outright where stale canon would remain misleading if left in place.
