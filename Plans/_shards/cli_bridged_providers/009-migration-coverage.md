Phase 2B atomized `CLI_Bridged_Providers-S0001` through `CLI_Bridged_Providers-S0010` into fine-grained PlanUnits `CBP-002` through `CBP-018`. `CBP-001` is retained only as a retired migration-lineage bridge and must not re-own atomized source coverage. This phase did not update Spec Lock, generated shards, evidence bundles, auto_decisions, or plan_graph, and it did not create WorkNodes, NodeSeeds, or executable build tasks.
