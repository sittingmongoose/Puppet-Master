## Runtime Scheduler Packet Tie-In Note (2026-03-08)

The runtime scheduler/retry/safe-point packet aligns with the rewrite architecture as follows:
- event-driven scheduler updates match the rewrite-wide no-polling GUI rule
- queue analysis, remediation lineage, and blocked-state surfaces must derive from canonical event/projection state
- runtime safe points are distinct from user-facing restore/rollback history
- blocked outcomes remain first-class and must not be flattened into generic failures in rewrite-era UI or storage

This memo should cross-reference the packet-applied SSOT docs after they are updated so the rewrite narrative does not lag behind the canonical contracts.
