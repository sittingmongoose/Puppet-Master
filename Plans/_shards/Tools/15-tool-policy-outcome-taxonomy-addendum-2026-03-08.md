## Tool Policy Outcome Taxonomy Addendum (2026-03-08)

### Reconciliation addendum

This addendum applies row-level transfer coverage requirements for the mapped owner anchor. Source IDs and exact source tokens are preserved in packet metadata; prose below uses canonical wording for retired legacy terms.

- Required structural headings for this packet target:
  - ### Reconciliation addendum

#### Source target target-0506
- Reconciliation action: insert_after
- Replace scope: insert_only
- Required structural headings represented:
  - ### Reconciliation addendum
- Exact required items represented:
  - the tool outcome taxonomy still diverges from canonical blocked reason taxonomy
- Exact acceptance checks represented:
  - All coverage_row_ids listed on this target are represented without broad summary substitution.
  - All source_obligation_ids, source_seed_ids, and source_shard_ids are preserved in packet metadata.
  - Rows marked missing or partial receive concrete prose or structural additions under the mapped live anchor.
- Source lineage is preserved in packet metadata for coverage rows, source obligations, source seeds, source shards, gaps, fidelity refs, span group, and writer role.

### 1. Tool-layer outcomes must map into runtime blocked/failure classes

The tool system remains the canonical source of immediate tool-policy decisions, but those decisions must map cleanly into the shared runtime taxonomy.

Required mappings:
- `permission_denied` -> blocked / `permission_denied`
- `user_declined` -> blocked / `user_declined`
- `headless_ask_denied` -> blocked / `headless_ask_denied`
- `filesafe_blocked` -> blocked / `filesafe_blocked`
- `validation_blocked` -> blocked / implementation-specific reason code, not generic failure

### 2. blocked vs failed

If the tool call never executed because policy blocked it, the outcome is blocked/denied, not execution failure.

### 3. Runtime integration

Tool outcomes must carry enough information for runtime recovery UI:
- guard / policy source
- reason code
- recovery options where applicable
- whether the action executed at all

### 4. Acceptance criteria

- Tool-layer policy outcomes map deterministically into the shared runtime taxonomy.
- Non-executed tool calls are not mislabeled as execution failures.
- Recovery-capable blocked outcomes carry enough information for UI/assistant/orchestrator surfaces.
