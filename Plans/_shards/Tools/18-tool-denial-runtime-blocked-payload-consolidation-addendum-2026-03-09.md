## Tool Denial Runtime Blocked Payload Consolidation Addendum (2026-03-09)

### Reconciliation addendum

This addendum applies row-level transfer coverage requirements for the mapped owner anchor. Source IDs and exact source tokens are preserved in packet metadata; prose below uses canonical wording for retired legacy terms.

- Required structural headings for this packet target:
  - ### Reconciliation addendum

#### Source target target-0505
- Reconciliation action: insert_after
- Replace scope: insert_only
- Required structural headings represented:
  - ### Reconciliation addendum
- Exact required items represented:
  - Extend tool events with node/attempt/actor/account context and reconcile tool outcomes with canonical blocked codes.
  - Artifact, tool, blocked, and handoff surfaces still cannot explain which effective account/actor produced or approved the action they represent.
- Exact acceptance checks represented:
  - All coverage_row_ids listed on this target are represented without broad summary substitution.
  - All source_obligation_ids, source_seed_ids, and source_shard_ids are preserved in packet metadata.
  - Rows marked missing or partial receive concrete prose or structural additions under the mapped live anchor.
- Source lineage is preserved in packet metadata for coverage rows, source obligations, source seeds, source shards, gaps, fidelity refs, span group, and writer role.

Tool-layer refusals that affect execution MUST normalize into canonical runtime blocked semantics before UI or scheduler layers consume them.

### Canonical runtime-facing payload
Runtime-facing denial paths MUST expose:
- `blocked_reason_code`
- `allowed_action_ids[]`
- `executed_at_all`
- prerequisite metadata needed to bind the exact recovery command
- `failure_class?` only when the denial followed a classified attempt outcome

### Source mapping rules
- permission-layer denial -> `permission_denied`
- headless interactive denial -> `headless_ask_denied`
- user refusal -> `user_declined`
- FileSafe denial that stops execution -> `filesafe_blocked`
- plugin/tool hook denial that stops execution -> `plugin_hook_blocked`

### No success-shaped fallback rule
Tools MUST NOT convert denied work into success-shaped or generic-failure fallbacks. The blocked state must remain inspectable so scheduler, chat, and GUI surfaces can render the correct recovery path.
