## 11. Relationship to other plans

| Plan | How tool support relates |
|------|---------------------------|
| **rewrite-tie-in-memo.md** | Central tool registry + policy engine; no per-provider special cases; tool results in unified event model → seglog → projections. |
| **newtools.md** | GUI testing tools catalog, **MCP settings in GUI** (Context7, others), MCP config for all five platforms, cited web search (MCP option). Tool support here; MCP config/GUI there. |
| **storage-plan.md** | Tool invocation/completion events in seglog; tool latency/errors in analytics scan → redb; dashboard/usage rollups. |
| **agent-rules-context.md** | Rules and context injected into every run; tool policy and safe-edit (FileSafe) align with central policy. |
| **orchestrator-subagent-integration.md** | Run config and tier wiring; **41 subagents** canonical list (§4, subagent_registry); task tool validates subagent_type against this list. MCP and tool flags passed to platform runner from same run-config build. |
| **interview-subagent-integration.md** | Interview phase assignments use the same **41 subagents**; config (framework tools, MCP enabled) drives test strategy and PRD; same MCP/tool config available to interview runs. |
| **FileSafe.md** | Safe-edit and path/URL guards; runs in addition to tool permissions; map to central tool policy and patch/apply/verify pipeline. |
| **usage-feature.md** | Tool usage and cost can be reflected in usage rollups (from seglog/analytics). |
| **LSPSupport.md** | LSP MVP; lsp tool promoted (§3.4, §3.5); diagnostics in context; §9.1. |
| **human-in-the-loop.md** | "Ask" permission and tier-boundary approval; orchestrator ask vs HITL behavior. |
| **Media_Generation_and_Capabilities.md** | SSOT for `capabilities.get` and `media.generate` internal tools (§3.1); response shape, disabled reasons, slot extraction grammar, capability picker dropdown, backend routing, and UI copy. This doc registers the tools; that doc defines their full contracts. |
