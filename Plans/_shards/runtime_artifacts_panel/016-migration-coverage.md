Phase 2B batch 166 atomized `Runtime_Artifacts_Panel-S0001` through `Runtime_Artifacts_Panel-S0031` into fine-grained PlanUnits `RAP-002` through `RAP-024`. Phase 2B batch 167 structurally dispositioned generated tail spans `Runtime_Artifacts_Panel-S0032`, `Runtime_Artifacts_Panel-S0033`, and `Runtime_Artifacts_Panel-S0035`, and retired `Runtime_Artifacts_Panel-S0034` as the `RAP-001` bridge lineage. `RAP-001` is migration-lineage compatibility only and no longer uses `source_preserving_planunit` compile mode. These batches did not update Spec Lock, generated shards, evidence bundles, auto_decisions, or plan_graph, and they did not create WorkNodes, NodeSeeds, executable queues, final node manifests, production build tasks, implementation files, or source code.
