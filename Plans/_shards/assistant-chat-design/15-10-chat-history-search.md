## 10. Chat History Search

- **Human search:** Chat must support **search across chats / history** so **users** can find prior conversations and reuse context (e.g. search within current chat and, if applicable, across past chats or sessions). This is a first-class UI feature (search box, filters, results list). Implementation: Tantivy chat index fed by seglog projector (Plans/storage-plan.md).
- **Agent search:** **Agents** must also be able to **search through chat history** when answering or planning. Provide a way for the running agent (Assistant, Interview, or subagent) to query past messages or sessions -- e.g. via a tool/MCP, or by including a searchable index of chat history in the context pipeline -- so the agent can retrieve relevant prior decisions, explanations, or outcomes. Enables continuity (e.g. "last time we decided X") and avoids asking the user to re-paste old context. Implementation can share the same storage/index as human search (Tantivy) but must expose an agent-callable interface (tool, API, or injected context).
