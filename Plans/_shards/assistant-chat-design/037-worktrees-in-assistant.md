## Worktrees in Assistant

This section specifies the W.1-W.17 thread-level worktree binding feature: a per-thread worktree button in the chat header, worktree icon in the thread selector, merge-back flow, pre-merge test gate, and all associated lifecycle, data model, events, commands, settings, and error handling.

### W.0 Source Control consumer state

Assistant chat deep-links into Source Control without owning its accordion layout. Per-project Source Control section open/close (`/close`) state persists at `config:project:{pid}:source_control.accordion_state` as:

```json
{ "Changes": true, "Worktrees": false, "Branches/Stash": false, "History": false, "Graph": false }
```
