| 2026-02-22 (current) | Implementation-ready pass: §8 (phased implementation order, dependencies, startup/shutdown, first-run, testing, acceptance criteria); definitions (project_id, path_hash, window); extended event types (HITL, interview, run tier/iteration/verification, queue, plan_todo, thread archive/delete, subagent, editor lifecycle); extended redb keys (queue, plan_todo, thread_usage, file_tree_expanded, layout, recent_files, run/interview/hitl checkpoints) and value encoding; §5 gaps (implementation order, projectors when seglog empty); §6 problems (API contract, projector panic, project/thread lifecycle, queue/HITL restore, interview vs thread, retention, editor keys, thread_checkpoint cleanup, multi-instance HITL). |
| 2026-02-20 | Fleshed out: definitions, §2 how we do it (locations, seglog format, redb schema, projectors, analytics), §5 gaps, §6 problems, §7 enhancements; expanded checklist. |
