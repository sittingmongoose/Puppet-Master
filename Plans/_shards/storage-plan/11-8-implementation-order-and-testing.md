## 8. Implementation order and testing

### 8.1 Phased implementation order

- **Phase 1 -- seglog foundation**  
  Build first: app data root resolution, directory creation (`storage/seglog`, `storage/redb`, `storage/jsonl`, `storage/tantivy`), and seglog writer only (envelope format, seq, flush, optional rotation by size/day). No projectors, no redb.  
  **Exit criterion:** We can append events and read them back (by tailing or reading the segment file).

- **Phase 2 -- redb and schema**  
  Build: redb open under app data root, schema (namespaces/tables per §2.3: settings, sessions, runs, checkpoints, editor, rollups, review_rules), key patterns, and a migrations runner (version in meta, run migrations on open).  
  **Exit criterion:** We can read/write settings and checkpoints (e.g. put/get in `settings` and `checkpoints` namespaces).

- **Phase 3 -- projector: seglog → JSONL mirror**  
  Build: single projector that tails seglog from a checkpoint, appends to the JSONL mirror (same envelope format), and persists its checkpoint in redb (`checkpoints` namespace).  
  **Exit criterion:** Tail seglog, write mirror, resume from checkpoint after restart (no duplicate mirror lines, checkpoint advances).

- **Phase 4 -- projector: seglog → Tantivy (chat index)**  
  Build: projector (or second projector) that reads seglog from checkpoint, indexes `chat.message` (and optionally `chat.thread_created`) into a Tantivy chat index (fields: thread_id, content, role, ts, message_id), and persists its checkpoint in redb.  
  **Exit criterion:** Events are indexed and search returns results (e.g. by content or thread_id).

- **Phase 5 -- analytics scan and rollups**  
  Build: analytics scan job (periodic or on-demand) that scans seglog (or JSONL mirror) over a time range, computes 5h/7d usage rollups, tool latency, and tool_usage (per-tool count, p50/p95, error_count per Plans/Tools.md §8.4), writes to redb `rollups` namespace, and stores a scan checkpoint.  
  **Exit criterion:** 5h/7d and tool rollups are written to redb and the UI (or a test reader) can read them.

- **Phase 6 -- wire chat, editor, and Usage**  
  Build: wire chat persistence (thread list and thread content to seglog; read from redb + seglog/snapshots per assistant-chat-design), editor state to redb `editor` namespace (FileManager.md §2.9), Usage/dashboard reading rollups from redb and triggering analytics scan (usage-feature.md); emit `usage.event` with `thread_id` and `run.completed` with optional usage snapshot.  
  **Exit criterion:** Full flow works: create thread, send message, events in seglog; projectors update mirror and index; Usage view shows rollups; editor state persists.

**Dependencies:** seglog writer before any projector; redb open + schema + migrations (including `checkpoints` and `rollups` namespaces) before projectors and analytics scan; projectors must not start until redb is open and checkpoints namespace exists; analytics scan must not run until rollups namespace (and scan checkpoint key) exists. Projectors may start once the seglog writer is initialized (current segment may be empty). When checkpoint is missing and seglog is empty, projector starts from position 0 and has nothing to process; when checkpoint is missing and seglog has data, projector starts from the beginning of the first segment.

### 8.2 Dependency graph

- **seglog writer** before any projector (projectors read seglog).
- **redb open + schema + migrations** before projector checkpoints (checkpoints namespace must exist).
- **checkpoints namespace** before any projector runs (projectors read/write checkpoint).
- **Event type schemas** (minimal set for writer) before or with Phase 1; full set before Phase 3/4/5.
- **rollups namespace** before analytics scan writes (Phase 2 defines it; Phase 5 uses it).
- **Tantivy chat index** before chat search UX (Phase 4 before Phase 6 chat wiring).
- **Chat/editor/Usage wiring** after Phase 1-5 storage primitives exist.

### 8.3 Startup and shutdown

**Startup order:** (1) Resolve app data root (env override optional). (2) Create `storage/seglog`, `storage/redb`, `storage/jsonl`, `storage/tantivy` if missing. (3) Open redb, run migrations (create namespaces and set schema_version on first run). (4) Open seglog writer (create first segment on first append if dir empty). (5) Start projectors (e.g. background threads or async tasks that tail seglog and write JSONL/Tantivy/checkpoints). (6) Optionally start analytics scan scheduler. This runs at app init (e.g. main or before UI).

**Shutdown:** (1) Signal projectors to stop (and flush). (2) Wait for projectors to commit last checkpoint and flush outputs (Tantivy commit, JSONL flush). (3) Flush and close seglog writer. (4) Close redb. Shutdown must complete within a timeout (e.g. 5s) or force-close to avoid hangs.

**Concurrency and single-writer:** The seglog writer is held by the main process; only one thread (or the main event loop) may call append, or append is protected by a mutex if multiple threads enqueue events. In-process single-writer guarantee: exactly one Writer instance; appends are serialized so that seq is monotonic and no concurrent appends occur. Projectors only **read** (tail) seglog and do not hold the writer; they run in background threads/tasks.

### 8.4 First run / empty state

- **Dirs:** If app data root exists but `storage/*` dirs are missing, create them (§2.1).
- **Seglog:** If `storage/seglog/` is empty, writer creates the first segment on first append; projectors reading checkpoint "none" start from offset 0 and see no events until the first append.
- **redb:** On first open, if no `schema_version` (or missing `meta` namespace), run initial migration that creates all namespaces and sets `schema_version` to 1. redb is created on first open if the file does not exist (standard redb behavior).
- **Projectors:** When checkpoint is missing, treat as "start from beginning of seglog" (first segment, offset 0); when seglog is empty, no work.
**Analytics Scan When Checkpoint Missing (Resolved):**

When the analytics scan checkpoint is missing (first run or after reset):
- Scan from **seq 0** (beginning of seglog).
- Rationale: ensures no data is missed. The seglog is append-only, so a full scan is safe and idempotent.
- For large seglogs, the scan is paginated: process **1000 events per batch**, yielding between batches to avoid blocking the event loop.
- After the scan completes, write the checkpoint to redb (`analytics:scan_checkpoint` → last processed seq).
- Subsequent runs resume from the checkpoint.
- Config: `analytics.scan_batch_size`, default `1000`.

### 8.5 Testing strategy

- **Phase 1:** Unit: app data root resolution; dir creation idempotent; seglog writer append and read-back/tail; rotation. Integration: append N events, close writer, open for read, assert all N lines and envelope fields.
- **Phase 2:** Unit: redb open/create; put/get in each namespace; migration runner. Integration: run migrations from version 0 to current; assert all namespaces usable.
- **Phase 3:** Unit: checkpoint read/write; tail logic; mirror append. Integration: append N events; run JSONL projector; assert mirror has N lines; restart projector, assert no duplicates and checkpoint advanced.
- **Phase 4:** Unit: Tantivy index add document and search by content and thread_id. Integration: append chat.message events; run chat projector; assert search results.
- **Phase 5:** Unit: rollup computation (usage by platform, tool percentiles). Integration: fixture seglog with known usage.event and tool.invoked; run analytics scan; assert rollup values in redb.
- **Phase 6:** Integration: end-to-end thread + message + projectors + search + Usage + editor state.

### 8.6 Acceptance criteria per phase

| Phase | Acceptance criteria |
|-------|----------------------|
| **1** | App data root resolved and storage dirs exist; seglog writer appends envelope-format events and they can be read back in order. |
| **2** | redb opens with current schema; migrations run on version change; settings and checkpoints can be written and read. |
| **3** | JSONL projector tails seglog, appends to mirror, and resumes from checkpoint after restart without duplicating or skipping events. |
| **4** | Chat projector indexes seglog events into Tantivy; search by content and thread_id returns expected results. |
| **5** | Analytics scan writes 5h/7d and tool_usage rollups to redb; a reader (e.g. UI or test) can read them. |
| **6** | Chat, editor, and Usage use seglog and redb; full flow (thread + message + projectors + search + Usage + editor state) works end-to-end. |
