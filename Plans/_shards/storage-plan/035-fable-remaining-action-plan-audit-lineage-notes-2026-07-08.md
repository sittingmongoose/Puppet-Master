## FABLE Remaining Action Plan Audit-Lineage Notes (2026-07-08)

These rows are preserved as audit-lineage notes only. They do not prove repair by themselves; repaired status requires concrete canonical prose/schema/enum/command/algorithm evidence in this owner doc or an explicit non-repair disposition in `Plans/.audits/fable-20260706/owner_note_closure_fidelity_after.jsonl`. This note creates no WorkNodes, NodeSeeds, queues, runtime artifacts, implementation files, production build tasks, final manifests, or PNC-019 receipts, and it does not mark `buildability_gate_passed` true.

- `registry_line 119` (repaired; source line 550; `sfk-a1de91e6d5aa62a6816874f1`): kv.json/prompt-history.jsonl decision repaired: product path is migration to canonical seglog/redb families; atomic file write/locking is transitional debug/export mirror protection only. Source summary: - [HIGH] L2003: `kv.json`/`prompt-history.jsonl` "must either be migrated or protected by atomic write" unresolved either/or, no target key FIX: pick one path now.
