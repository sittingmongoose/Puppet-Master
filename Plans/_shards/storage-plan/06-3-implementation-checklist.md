## 3. Implementation checklist

- [ ] **Resolve app data root** and create `storage/seglog`, `storage/redb`, `storage/jsonl`, `storage/tantivy`.
- [ ] **Implement seglog writer:** envelope format (ts, seq, type, payload); rotation by size or day; flush on append.
- [ ] **Define event type schemas** for `chat.message`, `chat.thread_created`, `run.started`, `run.completed`, `usage.event`, `tool.invoked` (include optional `success`, `error`, `thread_id` per Plans/Tools.md §8.0), optional `tool.denied`, and any editor lifecycle events per FileManager.md.
- [ ] **Implement redb schema + migrations:** namespaces (settings, sessions, runs, checkpoints, editor, rollups, review_rules); key patterns as in §2.3; migration runner and version bump.
- [ ] **Implement projector: seglog → JSONL mirror** (tail, checkpoint, write mirror).
- [ ] **Implement projector: seglog → Tantivy** (chat index; optional docs/logs); incremental index updates; checkpoint.
- [ ] **Persist projector checkpoints** in redb under `checkpoints` namespace.
- [ ] **Implement analytics scan:** scan seglog (or JSONL) for usage/tool/run events; compute 5h/7d, tool latency, and **tool_usage** (per-tool count, p50/p95, error_count) rollups; write to redb `rollups` (including `tool_usage.{window}` per Plans/Tools.md §8.4); store scan checkpoint.
- [ ] **Wire chat persistence:** thread list and thread content write to seglog; read from redb (session metadata) and seglog or redb snapshots for full thread load (per assistant-chat-design.md).
- [ ] **Wire editor state:** open tabs, active tab, scroll/cursor per FileManager.md §2.9 into redb `editor` namespace.
- [ ] **Wire Usage/dashboard:** read 5h/7d and rollups from redb; trigger analytics scan on interval or when Usage view opens (per usage-feature.md).
- [ ] **Emit usage.event with thread_id:** When recording usage for Assistant or Interview runs, include **thread_id** in the event payload so per-thread usage (context circle, thread Usage tab) can be aggregated from seglog or usage.jsonl (usage-feature.md §5, assistant-chat-design §12).
- [ ] **Emit run.completed with optional usage snapshot:** When a run finishes, include optional **usage** in the `run.completed` payload (tokens_in, tokens_out, cost, thread_id) so dashboards and thread Usage tab can use run-level usage without scanning usage.event. Canonical per-request data remains usage.event.
