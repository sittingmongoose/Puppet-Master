## Permission Snapshot Storage and Safe-Point Namespace Addendum

### Permission snapshot storage

The `attempt_record` includes a `permission_snapshot` field containing the resolved permission state at attempt start.

**Schema:**
```json
{
  "snapshot_id": "uuid",
  "attempt_id": "uuid",
  "node_id": "uuid",
  "captured_at": "ISO-8601 timestamp",
  "resolved_permissions": {
    "<permission_key>": {
      "resolution": "allow | deny | ask",
      "source": "preset | project | user_override | session",
      "effective_value": true
    }
  }
}
```

**Rules:**
1. Created at `attempt.started` emission, before any tool invocation.
2. Immutable after creation -- permission changes during the attempt do NOT retroactively modify the snapshot.
3. Used for audit trail and for determining whether a permission change requires attempt restart.

### Safe-point vs restore-point namespace separation

Safe points and restore points use distinct storage key prefixes:

| Type | Key prefix | Scope |
|------|-----------|-------|
| Safe point | `sp:{run_id}:{node_id}:{attempt_id}:{safe_point_id}` | Runtime-internal, scoped to run/node/attempt |
| Restore point | `rp:{project_id}:{restore_point_id}` | User-facing, scoped to project |

These namespaces MUST NOT overlap. Queries for safe points MUST use the `sp:` prefix; queries for restore points MUST use the `rp:` prefix.
