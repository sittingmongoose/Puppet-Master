## 5. Gaps and how we address them

The remaining persistence gaps for the rewrite shell are addressed by explicit owner-aligned state instead of feature-local ad hoc blobs.

### 5.1 Unsaved editor recovery is required, not optional
Rules:
- recover-unsaved is required MVP behavior for local and remote-backed buffers
- recovery snapshots store local buffer state, capture metadata, host/path identity, and write availability at capture time
- remote-backed recovery banners must say `Recovered local edits — remote destination not yet synchronized`
- save success is only claimed after the effective destination confirms the write

Implementation spec:
- key: `editor_state.v1:{project_id}:{file_path_hash}`
- stores: cursor position, scroll offset, selection ranges, undo stack reference, and unsaved changes flag
- recovery trigger: on session restore, reload each open editor's state before restoring focus
- conflict handling: if the file changed on disk since the last save, show a diff and let the user choose how to resolve the mismatch

### 5.2 Requested vs effective runtime state must remain visible
The persistence model stores enough context to reconstruct effective behavior honestly after restart.

Required stored distinctions:
- requested vs effective browser runtime/capabilities
- requested vs effective LSP enablement and attached-server set
- freshness vs health vs write availability for remote-backed projections
- restore outcome for historical Search, LSP, browser, and editor recovery surfaces

Implementation spec:
- key patterns: `{resource_type}_requested.v1:{scope}:{id}` and `{resource_type}_effective.v1:{scope}:{id}`
- requested state is what the user or system asked for; effective state is what actually applies after resolution
- projection freshness is persisted as `current`, `refreshing`, or `stale`
- `current` means just resolved, `refreshing` means re-resolution is in progress, and `stale` means the projection needs refresh before it should be treated as current

### 5.3 Search and Source Control keep separate projection state
Rules:
- Search state stores text query intent and query snapshots
- Source Control state stores repo projections, compare origins, and review context
- diff-local search does not get persisted as project Search state
- editor markers consume Source Control/LSP projections but do not become a substitute owner

Implementation spec:
- keys: `search_projection.v1:{project_id}` and `sc_projection.v1:{project_id}`
- Search projection stores last query, results, filter state, and scope
- Source Control projection stores branch, diff state, staged files, and commit message draft
- editor markers consume these projections but do not own them

### 5.4 Host-aware LSP persistence and restart behavior
Rules:
- LSP lifecycle and restart budgets are persisted by host-aware session key
- restart/reconnect preserves enough state to disclose whether a projection is current, refreshing, stale, degraded, or unavailable
- remote-mode projects never restore into a silent local fallback path

Implementation spec:
- key: `lsp_server_state.v1:{host_id}:{server_id}:{root_hash}`
- stores: server config, capabilities snapshot, last known status, and restart count
- recovery path: on session restore, restart LSP servers using the persisted config
- persisted restart counts survive reconnects so budget enforcement and degraded-state disclosure remain stable after restart
