## DL-042 — Historical TODO Event Migration Consumer Boundary (2026-09-11)

Storage preserves historical `chat.plan_todo_updated` reads under existing access, retention and deletion rules. TDR-012 in `Plans/ToDo_Runtime.md` owns the complete mapping. Storage must establish the complete atomic mutation/projection boundary before execution consumes revised state; incomplete future event admission cannot fall back to legacy appends or partial durable publication.
