This addendum applies row-level transfer coverage requirements for the mapped owner anchor. Source IDs and exact source tokens are preserved in packet metadata; prose below uses canonical wording for retired legacy terms.

- Required structural headings for this packet target:
  - ### Reconciliation addendum

#### Source target target-0480
- Reconciliation action: insert_after
- Replace scope: insert_only
- Required structural headings represented:
  - ### Reconciliation addendum
- Exact required items represented:
  - review scope, findings counts, unresolved findings, verdict, canonical findings summary ref
- Exact acceptance checks represented:
  - All coverage_row_ids listed on this target are represented without broad summary substitution.
  - All source_obligation_ids, source_seed_ids, and source_shard_ids are preserved in packet metadata.
  - Rows marked missing or partial receive concrete prose or structural additions under the mapped live anchor.
- Source lineage is preserved in packet metadata for coverage rows, source obligations, source seeds, source shards, gaps, fidelity refs, span group, and writer role.
Run Graph is the canonical graph/lineage inspection surface for orchestrated execution.

Rules:
- graph nodes are runtime nodes, not tiers
- graph lineage spans generations when graph patching occurs
- blocked/recovery/promotion/corroboration state belongs in graph detail when it pertains to the selected node or related lineage object
