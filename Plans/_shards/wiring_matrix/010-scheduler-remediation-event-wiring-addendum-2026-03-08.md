## Scheduler/Remediation/Event Wiring Addendum (2026-03-08)

Compatibility/source-lineage disposition: this historical wiring addendum preserves exact producer, consumer, event, and projection tokens. It is a compatibility/source-lineage section; named wiring PlanUnits and Contracts_V0 event identities govern overlapping runtime wiring precedence.

Add the following producer -> consumer paths to the wiring matrix.

### 1. Scheduler analysis

- canonical event: `scheduler.pass` (legacy alias: `run.scheduler_analysis`)
- producer: executor/orchestrator scheduler pass
- consumers: Run Graph View queue-analysis panel, storage `scheduler_pass_record` projection, usage/analytics dashboard
- storage projection: `scheduler_pass.{run_id}.{scheduler_pass_id}`

### 2. Blocked/unblocked

- canonical events: `node.blocked`, `node.unblocked`, `wizard.blocked`, `wizard.unblocked` (legacy aliases: `run.node_blocked`, `run.node_unblocked`)
- producer: executor/orchestrator blocked-state manager
- consumers: Run Graph View node badge/detail, assistant-chat blocked_notice, dashboard blocked-count badge, storage `blocked_projection`
- storage projection: `blocked_projection.{run_id}.{node_id}.{blocked_sequence}`

### 3. Safe points
- producer: mutation-capable attempt dispatcher / retry controller
- canonical events: `safe_point.created`, `safe_point.restored`
- consumers: runtime recovery logic, Run Graph detail panel, audit/debug surfaces

### 4. Remediation lineage

- canonical events: `remediation.spawned`, `remediation.resolved` (legacy aliases: `run.remediation_started`, `run.remediation_completed`)
- producer: executor/orchestrator remediation manager
- consumers: Run Graph View remediation lineage tree, storage `remediation_lineage_record`, dashboard remediation badge
- storage projection: `remediation.{run_id}.{remediation_root_id}`

### 5. Degradation evidence
- producer: draft decomposition/planning pipeline
- canonical event: `plan.decomposition_degraded`
- consumers: wizard/interview planning UI, storage projections, audit/debug surfaces
