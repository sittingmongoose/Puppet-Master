## DL-043 — Accepted Jujutsu Surface And Contract Planning (2026-09-11)

This addendum compiles accepted planning decisions only. Live semantic owners retain command admission, native behavior, authorization and evidence authority. Existing command schemas and production wiring remain unchanged.

### WM-054 — Jujutsu Planned Consumer Wiring And Observable Results

```yaml
plan_unit_id: WM-054
unit_type: integration_contract
status: accepted
owner_doc: Plans/Wiring_Matrix.md
canonical_text: UCC-162/UCC-163 define planned consumer obligations only. Future wiring routes all Jujutsu semantic
  effects through the Source Control/Jujutsu boundary and PM-owned separate internal adapter service; no UI/agent
  consumer owns subprocesses or bypasses existing owner services. Existing production command/schema admission
  is unchanged.
gui_related: true
gui_classification_reason: Defines visible actions, state, producer/consumer routes and user feedback.
depends_on:
- UCC-162
- UCC-163
- JJI-003
- JJI-009
- CV-330
unblocks: []
acceptance_criteria:
- Each action in UCC-163 receives an exact owner route and registered handler only after admission, plus intended
  reverse consumers and typed availability/result projection. View-local reads cannot dispatch mutation, and stateful
  effects cannot hide behind a local action.
- Group undo, redo, selected-operation reversal, rewrite preview/apply and historical browsing have distinct routing
  and result semantics matching F3-553/F3-554. Shared UI furniture cannot collapse these routes.
- Accepted work links ObservableWork; every established terminal command_result references its typed owner receipt
  for succeeded, blocked, failed, cancelled, recovery_required or effect_unknown. Consumers distinguish acceptance,
  completion, partial steps and unknown effect and restore exact caller context.
- Read-only, stale identity, lease loss, denied authorization, FileSafe block, unsupported adapter/target, handler_unavailable
  and unknown capability prevent dispatch with stable focus and explained remediation. Restart/cancellation reconciles
  owner work and receipts, never process-exit inference.
- Internal service routing preserves current Server/Client and workspace ownership. No shared public multi-repository
  daemon, IDE endpoint, MCP surface, third-party diff engine or external-agent route is introduced.
validation_surfaces:
- Future owner-qualified request/result, stale identity, denied, cancellation, partial and unknown-effect fixtures
- python3 scripts/pm-plan-index.py validate

negative_constraints:
- 'Planning only: no new admitted command ID, native handler, runtime readiness, EventRecord family, schema widening,
  WorkNode, NodeSeed or governance seal follows from this unit.'
- Declined DL-043 dispositions remain declined; do not reopen them or add a third-party diff/source-control library,
  external IDE/MCP interface, shared public service, custom publish hooks, specialized storage or specialized
  AI workspace-review workflow.
owner_boundary_notes:
- Jujutsu and Source Control own native semantics and admitted command contracts; Final GUI owns presentation,
  Backup owns restore/completion/maintenance policy, FileManager owns newline behavior, Permissions and FileSafe
  independently own safety, and Forge owns hosted workflows.
