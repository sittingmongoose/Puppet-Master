Original spans from `Prompt_Pipeline-S0001` through `Prompt_Pipeline-S0020` are preserved in place and atomized into fine-grained PlanUnits `PP-002` through `PP-026`. Original spans from `Prompt_Pipeline-S0021` through `Prompt_Pipeline-S0042` are preserved in place and atomized into fine-grained PlanUnits `PP-027` through `PP-053`. Generated structural/audit spans `Prompt_Pipeline-S0043` through `Prompt_Pipeline-S0046` are dispositioned in Phase 2B batch 155, and `PP-001` is retired to migration-lineage-only compatibility disposition. `Plans/Prompt_Pipeline.md` has no residual source-preserving product coverage. This batch did not update Spec Lock, generated shards, evidence bundles, auto_decisions, or plan_graph, and it did not create WorkNodes, NodeSeeds, executable queues, final node manifests, production build tasks, implementation files, or source code.
