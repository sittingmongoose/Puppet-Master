## 2. Problem Statement

**We should be concerned** about accumulation of agent-left-behind content: documents, tests, evidence, and builds can clutter the workspace and evidence directories if there is no cleanup policy. Agents run in fresh processes per iteration (CU-P2-T12). They can leave behind:

- **Docs:** Extra `.md` files (notes, plans, fragments), sometimes in repo root or `src/`.
- **Tests / scripts:** One-off test files, run scripts, or temporary harnesses.
- **Artifacts:** Build outputs (e.g. `target/` if not already ignored), test output dirs, installers from testing.
- **Temp files:** Editor backups, debug logs, or platform-specific temp dirs created in the workspace.

REQUIREMENTS.md specifies "Clean working directory state (git checkout to last commit)" and a runner contract with `prepare_working_directory` and `cleanup_after_execution`, but these are **not implemented** in `puppet-master-rs`. A plain `git checkout` only resets **tracked** files; **untracked** files remain. Without a cleanup policy and implementation, agent-left-behind content accumulates.
