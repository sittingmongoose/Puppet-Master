## Migration Coverage

All original spans from `Decision_Log-S0001` through `Decision_Log-S0026` are preserved in place. Phase 2B batch 043 atomized or structurally dispositioned those spans into `DL-002` through `DL-026`, the retired `DL-001` bridge, and explicit structural coverage_map dispositions. `DL-001` is retained only as migration-lineage compatibility coverage and must not re-own atomized source coverage. This batch did not update Spec Lock, generated shards, evidence bundles, auto_decisions, or plan_graph, and it did not create WorkNodes, NodeSeeds, executable queues, final node manifests, or production build tasks.
