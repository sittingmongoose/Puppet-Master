## Source Control, GitHub Actions, and Docker Manager MVP Consolidation Addendum (2026-03-12)

### GUI and views
- first-class `Source Control` side-panel surface with Changes, History, Graph, Worktrees, and Branches / Stash
- first-class `GitHub Actions` side-panel surface with Current Branch, Workflows, and Settings
- first-class `Docker Manager` side-panel surface with Containers, Images, Compose, Registries, Build / Bake, Publish / Unraid, and project-focused Kubernetes

ContractRef: ContractName:Plans/FinalGUISpec.md, ContractName:Plans/GitHub_Integration.md, ContractName:Plans/Containers_Registry_and_Unraid.md

### Orchestration and recovery
- run-to-repo lineage and worktree ownership surfaced across Orchestrator tabs
- run-to-workflow and workflow-to-diff correlation
- publish/runtime/template and Kubernetes rollout linkage surfaced in Orchestrator and Run Graph
- cross-surface `Open in Source Control`, `Open in GitHub Actions`, and `Open in Docker Manager` pivots

ContractRef: ContractName:Plans/Orchestrator_Page.md, ContractName:Plans/Run_Graph_View.md, ContractName:Plans/storage-plan.md

### State and commands
- Source Control, GitHub Actions, and Docker Manager panel state persisted per project where applicable
- new canonical command families for Source Control, GitHub Actions, Docker Manager, and cross-surface pivots
- blocked-state and requested-vs-effective rules remain product-wide behavior, not panel-local polish
