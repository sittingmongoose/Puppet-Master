## Debug-capable investigation orchestration


Orchestrator may launch shared investigations when builds, tests, environment setup, or runtime verification fail.

Required rules:
- Orchestrator does not switch into the Assistant `Debug` mode strip; instead, it uses the same shared investigation contracts and debug-capable tools under orchestration ownership
- investigation state remains subordinate to the owning attempt / remediation lineage rather than replacing orchestrator run identity
- delegated workers may contribute evidence, traces, or fixes to the same `investigation_id` when they are operating on the same issue
- only one mutation-capable investigation may target the same project/worktree at a time unless the orchestrator explicitly isolates work in a separate worktree or host context
