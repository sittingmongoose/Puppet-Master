## Plan Document Status

**This is a PLAN DOCUMENT ONLY** -- No code changes have been made. This document contains:
- Dynamic subagent selection strategy for each capability lane, agent role, write mode, and compatibility tier view
- Language/technology detection and matching
- Implementation architecture
- Code changes required
- Configuration options

Browser-capability rethink entries in this planning-doc are research inputs, not direct implementation authority by themselves. They may survey capability breadth, behavior contracts and `/state` model, UX flows, safety and `/permissions`, and chat `/planning` integration, but canonical product/runtime changes must be transferred into the owning live `Plans/**` docs before implementation.

Tier-level phrasing in this status block is compatibility and search-lineage only. Live orchestration uses capability_lane, agent_role, write_mode, certification_tier, and graph/package/seam/lane identity.
