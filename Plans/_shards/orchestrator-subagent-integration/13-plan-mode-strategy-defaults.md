## Plan Mode Strategy & Defaults

The orchestrator must follow the reconciled PM rule for delegated work in `ask` and `plan`.

Canonical decision:
- `ask` and `plan` may launch delegated child runs only for read-only research or analysis.
- required planning dependencies may still be child runs when they remain read-only.
- parent mode is a hard ceiling.
- the orchestrator must not silently widen a read-only planning run into execution authority.

The orchestrator should classify planning children as `required` or `optional` so planning completion and summarization behave deterministically.
