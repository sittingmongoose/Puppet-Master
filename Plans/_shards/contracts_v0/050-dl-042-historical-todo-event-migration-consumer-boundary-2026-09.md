## DL-042 — Historical TODO Event Migration Consumer Boundary (2026-09-11)

Contracts retains the shared EventRecord envelope and historical six-field payload shape reference for `chat.plan_todo_updated`; the proposed static schema is not append authority or proof of every historical writer shape. TDR-012 in `Plans/ToDo_Runtime.md` owns the complete approved mapping, compatibility semantics and admission gaps. No automatic alias or new legacy append is authorized.
