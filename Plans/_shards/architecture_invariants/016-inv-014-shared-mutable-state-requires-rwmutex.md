## INV-014 -- Shared mutable state requires RWMutex


### Rule

Any data structure shared across threads or async tasks that can be mutated MUST be protected by an `RwLock`/`RWMutex` (or equivalent). Lock-free approaches are allowed only when formally justified. Silent data races are prohibited. Permission state mutations in `Permissions_System` EXEC paths are covered by this invariant.
