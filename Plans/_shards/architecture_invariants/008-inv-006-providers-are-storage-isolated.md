## INV-006 -- Providers are storage-isolated

**Rule:** Providers and provider adapters MUST NOT write directly to persistent storage (`seglog`, `redb`, `Tantivy`, sparse n-gram index files, or remote-cache state). They emit normalized events or tool results; PM-owned storage writers, projectors, and cache managers own persistence.
