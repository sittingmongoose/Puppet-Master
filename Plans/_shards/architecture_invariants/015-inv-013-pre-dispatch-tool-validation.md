## INV-013 -- Pre-dispatch tool validation


`policy.may_execute_tool()` MUST be called for every tool dispatch at every nesting depth regardless of invocation path. No child-run, plugin path, provider surface, or shell bridge may bypass this invariant.

ContractRef: ContractName:Plans/Permissions_System.md, ContractName:Plans/Tools.md

Enforcement may be static (import-graph / compile-time gate) or runtime (central dispatch gate), but direct calls to tool implementations without this permission gate are prohibited.
