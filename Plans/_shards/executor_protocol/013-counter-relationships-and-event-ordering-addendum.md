## Counter Relationships and Event Ordering Addendum

### Counter relationships

```
attempt_count = automatic_retry_count
             + prerequisite_resume_count
             + manual_resume_count
             + remediation_retry_count
             + 1 (initial attempt)
```

- `attempt_count` is the total number of attempts for a node across all causes.
- Each sub-counter tracks attempts triggered by a specific cause.
- The sum of all sub-counters plus the initial attempt MUST equal `attempt_count`.
- Each sub-counter increments at attempt start, not at completion.
- Independent policy counters MUST NOT be inferred by subtracting from `attempt_count`.

Debug-mode verification records a `verification_summary` with `adapter_kind`, `attempt_count`, `passed`, `heuristic_version`, optional `latest_receipt_ref`, and optional `notes[]`. Agent-session verification passes only when the prior `failure_class`, `blocked_reason_code`, or tool error signature does not recur and the rerun reaches the expected terminal state for that adapter.

### Event ordering guarantees

1. **Per-node sequential**: All events for a given `node_id` MUST be processed in emission order. The event bus MUST NOT reorder events within a single node's event stream.
2. **Cross-node eventual**: Events from different nodes have no guaranteed relative order. Consumers MUST be idempotent and tolerate out-of-order delivery across nodes.
3. **Deduplication**: The event bus MUST deduplicate events by `(event_name, node_id, attempt_id, ts)` tuple. Duplicate deliveries are silently dropped.
4. **Wakeup coalescing**: Multiple wakeup triggers arriving within a single scheduler pass window are coalesced into one scheduler pass. The `wake_reason` for the pass records the first trigger; additional triggers are logged but do not cause additional passes.

### Replan generation lifecycle

`replan_generation` is a per-run monotonic `u32` counter starting at `0` for the initial graph.

- Increments by exactly 1 each time a replan is applied and the canonical graph is updated via `run.graph_canonical_locked`.
- A replan is defined as any structural change to the canonical graph (adding/removing/reordering nodes or edges).
- Attempts, safe points, and blocked projections created under generation N become stale when generation increments to N+1.
- Stale attempts remain queryable for audit but are never resumable.
- There is no practical maximum value.
