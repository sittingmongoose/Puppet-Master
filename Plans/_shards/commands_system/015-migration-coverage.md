Phase 2B atomized `Commands_System-S0001` through `Commands_System-S0053` into fine-grained PlanUnits `CS-002` through `CS-049`. `CS-001` is retained only as a retired migration-lineage bridge and must not re-own atomized source coverage. This phase did not update Spec Lock, generated shards, evidence bundles, auto_decisions, or plan_graph, and it did not create WorkNodes, NodeSeeds, executable queues, final node manifests, or production build tasks.
