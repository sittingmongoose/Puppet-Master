## Runtime Worktree Conflict Reconciliation Addendum (2026-03-09)

### Reconciliation addendum

This addendum applies row-level transfer coverage requirements for the mapped owner anchor. Source IDs and exact source tokens are preserved in packet metadata; prose below uses canonical wording for retired legacy terms.

- Required structural headings for this packet target:
  - ### Reconciliation addendum

#### Source target target-0541
- Reconciliation action: insert_after
- Replace scope: insert_only
- Required structural headings represented:
  - ### Reconciliation addendum
- Exact required items represented:
  - newer model: scored ready set, `scheduler_lane`, `replan_generation`, runnable-unit fields like `attempt_id`, blocked reason codes, worktree conflict classification
  - scheduler_lane
  - replan_generation
  - attempt_id
  - worktree conflict / dirty-worktree block
- Exact acceptance checks represented:
  - All coverage_row_ids listed on this target are represented without broad summary substitution.
  - All source_obligation_ids, source_seed_ids, and source_shard_ids are preserved in packet metadata.
  - Rows marked missing or partial receive concrete prose or structural additions under the mapped live anchor.
- Source lineage is preserved in packet metadata for coverage rows, source obligations, source seeds, source shards, gaps, fidelity refs, span group, and writer role.

This addendum is retained as historical context only.

Canonical worktree-conflict and dirty-worktree runtime rules now live in `## Worktree Conflict and Dirty-Worktree Runtime Alignment`.

Canonical blocked reasons for this domain are `worktree_conflict` and `dirty_worktree`.

Required rules:
- blocked payloads use canonical blocked fields and ordered `allowed_action_ids[]`
- recovery may require safe-point restore when the runtime marks `requires_safe_point_restore = true`
- clearing the underlying worktree issue resolves the blocked prerequisite; it does not fabricate a new failure class
- worktree conflict resolution must preserve lineage to the blocked episode and any affected safe point

Required fields:
- blocked_reason_code
- blocked_reason_detail
- remediation_actions_allowed
- dirty_state
- conflict_state

Canonical terms and values:
- blocked_reason_code
- remediation_actions_allowed

Labels:
- dirty worktree

Behavioral rules:
- `dirty_worktree` and `worktree_conflict` stay canonical blocked reasons instead of generic SCM failures.
- Conflict and cleanup semantics must remain distinct.

Permission carry-through:
- remediation actions must surface only through the allowed-action set
