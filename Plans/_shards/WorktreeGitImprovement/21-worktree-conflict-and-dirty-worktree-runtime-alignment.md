## Worktree Conflict and Dirty-Worktree Runtime Alignment

Canonical blocked reasons for this domain are `worktree_conflict` and `dirty_worktree`.

Required rules:
- blocked payloads use canonical blocked fields and ordered `allowed_action_ids[]`
- recovery may require safe-point restore when the runtime marks `requires_safe_point_restore = true`
- clearing the underlying worktree issue resolves the blocked prerequisite; it does not fabricate a new failure class
- worktree conflict resolution must preserve lineage to the blocked episode and any affected safe point
