## Canonical Wizard Blocked Lifecycle

### Reconciliation addendum

This addendum applies row-level transfer coverage requirements for the mapped owner anchor. Source IDs and exact source tokens are preserved in packet metadata; prose below uses canonical wording for retired legacy terms.

- Required structural headings for this packet target:
  - ### Reconciliation addendum

#### Source target target-0586
- Reconciliation action: insert_after
- Replace scope: insert_only
- Required structural headings represented:
  - ### Reconciliation addendum
- Exact required items represented:
  - wizard blocked state
  - the `wizard.blocked` minimum payload earlier in the file requires `resume_url`
  - wizard.blocked
  - resume_url
- Exact acceptance checks represented:
  - All coverage_row_ids listed on this target are represented without broad summary substitution.
  - All source_obligation_ids, source_seed_ids, and source_shard_ids are preserved in packet metadata.
  - Rows marked missing or partial receive concrete prose or structural additions under the mapped live anchor.
- Source lineage is preserved in packet metadata for coverage rows, source obligations, source seeds, source shards, gaps, fidelity refs, span group, and writer role.

### Canonical `wizard_status`
See canonical `wizard_status` definition in §2.1.

### Canonical blocked state
ContractRef: ContractName:Plans/Contracts_V0.md, ContractName:Plans/storage-plan.md, ContractName:Plans/assistant-chat-design.md
A wizard blocked record MUST persist:
ContractRef: ContractName:Plans/Contracts_V0.md, ContractName:Plans/storage-plan.md, ContractName:Plans/assistant-chat-design.md
- `wizard_id`
- `wizard_step`
- `blocked_reason_code`
- `clarification_round_count`
- `report_ref`
- `resume_url?`
- `decomposition_degraded`
- `degradation_reason?`
- `replan_generation?`
- `attempted_recovery_action_ids[]`

ContractRef: ContractName:Plans/Contracts_V0.md, ContractName:Plans/storage-plan.md, ContractName:Plans/assistant-chat-design.md

### Blocked clear rule
A wizard leaves `blocked` only when:
- materially new user input creates a new issue set
- the external prerequisite named by `blocked_reason_code` is actually resolved
- a new `replan_generation` begins for the wizard context
- the wizard is cancelled

Reopening the same blocked wizard without one of those changes does not clear blocked state and does not reset `clarification_round_count`.
