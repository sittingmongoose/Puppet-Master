Phase 2B atomized `chain-wizard-flexibility-S0001` through `chain-wizard-flexibility-S0154` into fine-grained PlanUnits `CWF-002` through `CWF-147`. `CWF-001` is retained only as a retired migration-lineage bridge and must not re-own atomized source coverage. This phase did not update Spec Lock, generated shards, evidence bundles, auto_decisions, or plan_graph, and it did not create WorkNodes, NodeSeeds, or executable build tasks.
