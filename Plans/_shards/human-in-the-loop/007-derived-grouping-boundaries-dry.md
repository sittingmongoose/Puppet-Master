## Derived Grouping Boundaries (DRY)


Tier boundaries are not a co-equal execution model.

Rules:
- approvals do not bind to `tier_id` as the canonical execution scope
- any surviving tier or phase labels are derived grouping/view concepts only
- approval and recovery flows bind to runtime blocked episodes anchored by `run_id`, `node_id`, `blocked_sequence`, and `attempt_id?`
