## 3. How OpenCode Does It (Reference for Rewrite)

### Reconciliation addendum

This addendum applies row-level transfer coverage requirements for the mapped owner anchor. Source IDs and exact source tokens are preserved in packet metadata; prose below uses canonical wording for retired legacy terms.

- Required structural headings for this packet target:
  - ### Reconciliation addendum

#### Source target target-0348
- Reconciliation action: insert_after
- Replace scope: insert_only
- Required structural headings represented:
  - ### Reconciliation addendum
- Exact required items represented:
  - must be exact, but exact does not mean fully materialized at once
  - `account_switch_reason` currently does too much work as a single field.
  - account_switch_reason
  - `provider_attempt_ref` does not replace `attempt_id`
  - provider_attempt_ref
  - attempt_id
  - `inspector_target` does not replace `tab_id`.
  - inspector_target
  - tab_id
  - `tab_id` does not replace `target_kind`.
  - target_kind
  - `tab_id` does not replace `inspector_target`.
- Exact acceptance checks represented:
  - All coverage_row_ids listed on this target are represented without broad summary substitution.
  - All source_obligation_ids, source_seed_ids, and source_shard_ids are preserved in packet metadata.
  - Rows marked missing or partial receive concrete prose or structural additions under the mapped live anchor.
- Source lineage is preserved in packet metadata for coverage rows, source obligations, source seeds, source shards, gaps, fidelity refs, span group, and writer role.

We are aligning with OpenCode-style architecture where useful; their LSP approach is a good reference.

**Official documentation:** [LSP Servers \| OpenCode](https://opencode.ai/docs/lsp/) -- canonical reference for built-in servers, config, and behavior.

### 3.1 Summary from opencode.ai/docs/lsp/

- **Stated purpose:** OpenCode integrates LSP so the **LLM can interact with the codebase**; it uses **diagnostics** to provide feedback to the LLM.
- **Built-in servers:** 30+ languages; see **§3.2** for the full table (server id, extensions, requirements). Each server is enabled when a file's extension matches and the requirement is met.
- **How it works:** When OpenCode opens a file, it (1) starts the appropriate LSP server if not already running, (2) checks the file extension against all enabled LSP servers. Servers are automatically enabled when an extension is detected and requirements are met.
- **Config:** `lsp` section in opencode config. Schema: `https://opencode.ai/config.json`. Per-server properties: `disabled` (boolean), `command` (string[]), `extensions` (string[]), `env` (object), `initialization` (object). Set `lsp: false` to disable all; set `OPENCODE_DISABLE_LSP_DOWNLOAD=true` to disable automatic LSP server downloads.
- **Custom servers:** Add entries with `command` (e.g. `["custom-lsp-server", "--stdio"]`) and `extensions`.
- **PHP Intelephense:** Premium features via license key; place key only in `%USERPROFILE%/intelephense/license.txt` (Windows) or `$HOME/intelephense/license.txt` (macOS/Linux).

### 3.2 Built-in LSP servers (full table)

We support the same set of built-in LSP servers as [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai/docs/lsp/) **plus slint-lsp** for Slint UI (`.slint`). When implementing the server registry, include all of the following so that Puppet Master can provide diagnostics and code intelligence for every listed language. Each row defines server id, file extensions, and requirements (command or dependency).

Servers are enabled when a file's extension matches and the requirement is met. Root discovery and spawn logic per server (e.g. Cargo.toml for Rust, package.json for eslint/TypeScript) are in OpenCode's server.ts; we align with that. See §3.3 for reinforced ESLint (JS/TS), §3.3.1 for Slint LSP, §3.4 for implementation notes, §3.5 for the root discovery table, and §3.6 for extension conflict rules.

### 3.5 Root discovery (per-server rules)

Root discovery is host-aware and context-driven.

Rules:
- session reuse key is `(host_id, server_id, root_identity)`
- `root_identity` is resolved from the effective project/worktree/remote root selected for the current document and server rules
- project language detection and preset suggestion are advisory only; actual attachment resolves from file path, effective host context, server rules, and user overrides
- remote-mode projects use remote host roots and MUST NOT silently attach against a hidden local mirror

ContractRef: ContractName:Plans/GitHub_Integration.md, ContractName:Plans/FileManager.md, ContractName:Plans/storage-plan.md

Root-selection steps:
1. determine the effective host context for the file
2. resolve candidate roots from file path and server heuristics
3. apply explicit per-project or per-server overrides
4. compute `root_identity` and attach/reuse the matching session if one exists

ContractRef: ContractName:Plans/FinalGUISpec.md, ContractName:Plans/Wiring_Matrix.md, ContractName:Plans/Contracts_V0.md

Language-specific root detection rules:

| Language | Root markers | Priority | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| JavaScript/TypeScript | package.json, tsconfig.json | package.json > tsconfig.json | Monorepo: each package.json is a root |
| Rust | Cargo.toml | — | Workspace: root Cargo.toml with [workspace] |
| Go | go.mod | — | Module root |
| Python | pyproject.toml, setup.py, setup.cfg | pyproject.toml > setup.py | venv detection separate |
| Java | pom.xml, build.gradle, build.gradle.kts | — | Multi-module: parent pom |
| C/C++ | CMakeLists.txt, Makefile, compile_commands.json | CMakeLists.txt > Makefile | |
| C# | *.sln, *.csproj | .sln > .csproj | Solution is workspace root |
| Ruby | Gemfile | — | |
| PHP | composer.json | — | |
| Swift | Package.swift, *.xcodeproj | Package.swift > xcodeproj | |

Fallback rule:
- if no language-specific marker is found, use the nearest `.git` directory as the root

### 3.6 Extension conflicts (multiple servers per extension)

### Reconciliation addendum

This addendum applies row-level transfer coverage requirements for the mapped owner anchor. Source IDs and exact source tokens are preserved in packet metadata; prose below uses canonical wording for retired legacy terms.

- Required structural headings for this packet target:
  - ### Reconciliation addendum

#### Source target target-0351
- Reconciliation action: insert_after
- Replace scope: insert_only
- Required structural headings represented:
  - ### Reconciliation addendum
- Exact required items represented:
  - Without a closed vocabulary, `inspector_target` will become a second untyped extension bag.
  - inspector_target
  - reject when `tab_id` conflicts with `target_kind`
  - tab_id
  - target_kind
- Exact acceptance checks represented:
  - All coverage_row_ids listed on this target are represented without broad summary substitution.
  - All source_obligation_ids, source_seed_ids, and source_shard_ids are preserved in packet metadata.
  - Rows marked missing or partial receive concrete prose or structural additions under the mapped live anchor.
- Source lineage is preserved in packet metadata for coverage rows, source obligations, source seeds, source shards, gaps, fidelity refs, span group, and writer role.

Multiple servers may overlap for one language or file kind; overlap is resolved through explicit selection metadata rather than one-off hard-coded exceptions.

Required metadata fields per effective catalog entry:
- `selection_mode`
- `selection_family`
- `primary_priority`
- `context_markers`
- `supplementary_families`
- `capability_profile`
- `degraded_attach_rules`

ContractRef: ContractName:Plans/storage-plan.md, ContractName:Plans/FinalGUISpec.md, ContractName:Plans/Decision_Policy.md

Rules:
- one primary server may own a capability family when exclusivity is required
- supplementary servers may coexist only when their capability families are declared compatible
- effective overlap resolution must remain user-visible in Settings > LSP and status surfaces
- remote/degraded attach rules must be explicit; the client must not fabricate healthy capability state when a server is disabled, unavailable, or partially attached

ContractRef: ContractName:Plans/GitHub_Integration.md, ContractName:Plans/assistant-chat-design.md, ContractName:Plans/Wiring_Matrix.md

### 3.3 ESLint and ECMAScript/JavaScript (reinforced)

**ESLint** is the primary lint and diagnostics LSP for **ECMAScript/JavaScript** (and commonly used with TypeScript, Vue, etc.) when users build programs with Puppet Master. We explicitly support and reinforce ESLint so that JS/TS projects get first-class linting and quick fixes in the editor and in Assistant/Interview context.

- **Upstream:** [eslint/eslint](https://github.com/eslint/eslint). **ESLint v10** (v10.0.0 / v10.0.1) is the current major line; it uses **flat config only** (`.eslintrc` removed). Config file: `eslint.config.js` or `eslint.config.mjs` / `eslint.config.ts`; lookup starts from the file's directory (monorepo-friendly). Node.js: ^20.19.0, ^22.13.0, or >=24.
- **LSP:** OpenCode's built-in **eslint** server uses the project's `eslint` dependency and runs the VS Code ESLint server (or equivalent) over stdio. Extensions: `.ts`, `.tsx`, `.js`, `.jsx`, `.mjs`, `.cjs`, `.mts`, `.cts`, `.vue`. Requirement: `eslint` dependency in project.
- **For our implementation:** When adding LSP, include **eslint** in the server registry for JS/TS projects. Root discovery: nearest directory containing `package.json` (or `eslint.config.js` / `eslint.config.mjs` / `eslint.config.ts` for v10). Prefer ESLint v10 flat config when present (`eslint.config.*`); do not rely on legacy `.eslintrc*`. Diagnostics from ESLint feed the Problems panel and LLM/Assistant context (§1, §5).
- **Preset alignment:** The JavaScript/TypeScript preset (FileManager §11) should list ESLint as an expected tool and, when LSP is added, enable the eslint LSP server for that preset. See FileManager.md §11 and preset detection (e.g. `package.json` + `eslint` dep or `eslint.config.*`).

### 3.3.1 Slint LSP (slint-lsp)

Our GUI is **Rust + Slint** (FinalGUISpec); we include **slint-lsp** so that editing `.slint` files in the in-app editor gets diagnostics, completion, goto definition, and live-preview support.

- **Crate:** [slint-lsp](https://crates.io/crates/slint-lsp) (latest stable 1.15.1). LSP implementation for [Slint](https://slint.dev). Binary: `slint-lsp` (or `slint-lsp.exe` on Windows). Communicates via **stdio** (stdin/stdout); no special command-line arguments -- editors spawn the binary and use LSP over stdio.
- **Features:** Diagnostics, code completion, goto definition, **live-preview**. Code formatting is part of the LSP (see [Slint tooling docs](https://snapshots.slint.dev/master/docs/guide/tooling/manual-setup/#slint-lsp)).
- **Install:** `cargo install slint-lsp`, or use pre-built binaries from [Slint GitHub releases](https://github.com/slint-ui/slint/releases). Requirement: `slint-lsp` command available on PATH.
- **Extensions:** `.slint` (Slint UI markup).
- **Root discovery:** For `.slint` files, root can be the file's directory or nearest project root (e.g. directory containing `Cargo.toml` if Slint is used in a Rust project). Many .slint files work with workspace root or file directory.
- **For our implementation:** Include **slint-lsp** in the server registry with id `slint-lsp`, extensions `[".slint"]`, and spawn `slint-lsp` (no args). When the user opens a `.slint` file in the File Editor, the LSP client starts slint-lsp for that root and provides diagnostics, hover, completion, and goto definition in the editor; live-preview can be wired separately if the LSP supports it. Settings > LSP: slint-lsp appears in the built-in list and can be toggled or configured (env, initialization) like other servers.

### 3.4 Implementation (server.ts)

- **Code:** `packages/opencode/src/lsp/server.ts` -- server registry, root discovery, spawn logic for each built-in (including **eslint** for JS/TS).
- **Server model:** One LSP server **process** per **`(host_id, server_id, root_identity)`**. Root discovery still begins from the file context and server heuristics (e.g. "nearest directory containing Cargo.toml" for Rust), but the supervised session key is host-aware.
- **Info shape:** `id`, `extensions[]`, `root(file, host_context) -> root identity`, `spawn(session_key) -> Handle | undefined`. **Handle:** `process` (child process) + optional `initialization` (options sent in LSP `initialize`).
- **Root discovery:** **NearestRoot(includePatterns, excludePatterns)** -- walk up from the file's directory until a target file is found. Exclude patterns avoid wrong server (e.g. Deno vs Node). Some servers use a fixed root (e.g. instance directory).
- **Lifecycle:** On file open, extension is matched to enabled servers; if a server is needed and not yet running for that host/root identity, it is **spawned** (stdio). Initialize handshake and optional `initializationOptions` complete the setup.

**Takeaways for us:**

- Registry of servers by (id, extensions, root-finder, spawn).
- Lazy spawn per `(host_id, server_id, root_identity)`; one process per effective host/root identity.
- Config to disable, override command, set env and initialization options (align with OpenCode's `lsp` schema).
- Optional auto-install (we can defer or limit; e.g. rust-analyzer from PATH, pyright/gopls optional install).
