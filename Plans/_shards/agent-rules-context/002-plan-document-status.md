## Plan Document Status

**This is a PLAN DOCUMENT ONLY** -- No code changes have been made. This document contains:
- Two durable rule scopes: Application (Puppet Master) level and Project level
- Where each is stored and how they are fed into every agent
- DRY: single rules pipeline consumed by orchestrator, interview, and Assistant
