Phase 2B batch 049 atomized `DRY_Rules-S0001` through `DRY_Rules-S0017` into `DR-002` through `DR-035`, structurally dispositioned `DRY_Rules-S0018`, `S0019`, `S0020`, and `S0022`, and retired `DR-001` as migration-lineage compatibility coverage for `DRY_Rules-S0021`. `Plans/DRY_Rules.md` now has no residual source-preserving product coverage. This batch did not update Spec Lock, generated shards, evidence bundles, auto_decisions, or plan_graph, and it did not create WorkNodes, NodeSeeds, or executable build tasks.
