## FABLE Deferred Action Concrete Repair Addendum - 2026-07-08

This addendum repairs non-runtime DRY rows without creating WorkNodes, implementation files, runtime artifacts, or PNC-019 evidence.

- Repairs `sfk-f265ed0e6287bed7e8ddb7cc`: the reference implementation path for text-normalization checks is `scripts/pm-plans-verify.py lint-contractrefs` for owner/ContractRef integrity and the DRY normalization algorithm embedded in `Plans/DRY_Rules.md` Section 7.1. CI/local enforcement is through `python3 scripts/pm-plans-verify.py run-gates`; future extraction to a dedicated script must preserve the same six-step algorithm.
