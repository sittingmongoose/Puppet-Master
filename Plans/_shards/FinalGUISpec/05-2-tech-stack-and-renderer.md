## 2. Tech Stack and Renderer

### Reconciliation addendum

This addendum applies row-level transfer coverage requirements for the mapped owner anchor. Source IDs and exact source tokens are preserved in packet metadata; prose below uses canonical wording for retired legacy terms.

- Required structural headings for this packet target:
  - ### Reconciliation addendum

#### Source target target-0254
- Reconciliation action: insert_after
- Replace scope: insert_only
- Required structural headings represented:
  - ### Reconciliation addendum
- Exact required items represented:
  - The owner-routing stack is not internally closed:
  - Owner stack:
- Exact acceptance checks represented:
  - All coverage_row_ids listed on this target are represented without broad summary substitution.
  - All source_obligation_ids, source_seed_ids, and source_shard_ids are preserved in packet metadata.
  - Rows marked missing or partial receive concrete prose or structural additions under the mapped live anchor.
- Source lineage is preserved in packet metadata for coverage rows, source obligations, source seeds, source shards, gaps, fidelity refs, span group, and writer role.

### 2.1 Core Stack

| Component | Technology | Notes |
|-----------|-----------|-------|
| Language | Rust | All logic, state management, and Slint bridge code |
| UI Framework | Slint 1.15.1 | `.slint` markup files compiled via `slint_build` in `build.rs` |
| Default Renderer | winit + Skia | Best quality and performance |
| Fallback Renderer | winit + FemtoVG-wgpu | When Skia is unavailable |
| Emergency Renderer | Software renderer | Headless/CI environments |
| Persistence (layout) | redb | Durable KV store for layout state, preferences, editor state |
| Persistence (events) | seglog | Canonical event ledger for usage, chat, orchestrator events |
| Search | Tantivy | Full-text search index over seglog projections |

### 2.2 What Is NOT Used

No React, JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML, or CSS. The entire GUI is Rust + Slint `.slint` markup.

### 2.3 Build Integration

```rust
// build.rs
fn main() {
    let config = slint_build::CompilerConfiguration::new()
        .with_style("cosmic".into());
    slint_build::compile_with_config("ui/app.slint", config).unwrap();
}
```

The `cosmic` base style is used because it supports `ColorScheme` toggling and has a neutral appearance that does not conflict with custom theming. All visual differences are driven by a `Theme` global in `.slint` rather than the base style.

### 2.4 Backend Selection

### Reconciliation addendum

This addendum applies row-level transfer coverage requirements for the mapped owner anchor. Source IDs and exact source tokens are preserved in packet metadata; prose below uses canonical wording for retired legacy terms.

- Required structural headings for this packet target:
  - ### Reconciliation addendum

#### Source target target-0278
- Reconciliation action: insert_after
- Replace scope: insert_only
- Required structural headings represented:
  - ### Reconciliation addendum
- Exact required items represented:
  - what old assumption is present: node-only lifecycle, lexicographic selection, no blocked/contaminated/restore-required states.
  - `inspector_target` only when the field is really a detail-pane selection, not the main identity
  - inspector_target
  - `target_kind` tells the router what class of surface must host the target after scope restoration and target selection are applied.
  - target_kind
- Exact acceptance checks represented:
  - All coverage_row_ids listed on this target are represented without broad summary substitution.
  - All source_obligation_ids, source_seed_ids, and source_shard_ids are preserved in packet metadata.
  - Rows marked missing or partial receive concrete prose or structural additions under the mapped live anchor.
- Source lineage is preserved in packet metadata for coverage rows, source obligations, source seeds, source shards, gaps, fidelity refs, span group, and writer role.

Backend is chosen at startup; all windows use the same backend. Selection uses `slint::BackendSelector::new().select()` with `SLINT_BACKEND` environment variable override. Cargo features control which renderers are compiled in (e.g., `default = ["renderer-skia"]`, optional `renderer-femtovg`).

Deterministic selection order:
1. Explicit valid `SLINT_BACKEND` override wins.
2. Otherwise use the persisted app preference if it maps to a compiled-in backend.
3. Otherwise use compiled default order: `winit + Skia` → `winit + FemtoVG-wgpu` → emergency software renderer.

Failure handling:
- An invalid override or unavailable preferred backend MUST emit a startup diagnostic and fall through deterministically to the next compiled-in backend.
- The selected backend MUST be shown in diagnostics/setup surfaces so fallback behavior is inspectable.

```rust
// main.rs entry point
fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    slint::BackendSelector::new().select()?;
    let ui = AppWindow::new()?;
    // ... state init, bridge wiring, effects generation
    ui.run()?;
    Ok(())
}
```
