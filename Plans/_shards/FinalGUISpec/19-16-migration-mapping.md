## 16. Migration Mapping

### Reconciliation addendum

This addendum applies row-level transfer coverage requirements for the mapped owner anchor. Source IDs and exact source tokens are preserved in packet metadata; prose below uses canonical wording for retired legacy terms.

- Required structural headings for this packet target:
  - ### Reconciliation addendum

#### Source target target-0250
- Reconciliation action: insert_after
- Replace scope: insert_only
- Required structural headings represented:
  - ### Reconciliation addendum
- Exact required items represented:
  - legacy `[retired-token-1]` wording still present in docs is now both a data-model risk and a user-copy/help migration risk
  - [retired-token-1]
  - Resolve the `[retired-token-3]` migration contradiction in one place and cross-reference it from `[retired-token-2]`
  - [retired-token-3]
  - [retired-token-2]
  - That makes the doc hard to reconcile mechanically because early tables, migration addenda, and canonical-record sections are not all pointing in the same direction.
- Legacy token retirement handling:
  - Retired token #1 is preserved exactly in packet metadata and must be omitted, replaced by canonical wording, or documented only as an explicitly deprecated legacy alias in live prose.
  - Retired token #2 is preserved exactly in packet metadata and must be omitted, replaced by canonical wording, or documented only as an explicitly deprecated legacy alias in live prose.
  - Retired token #3 is preserved exactly in packet metadata and must be omitted, replaced by canonical wording, or documented only as an explicitly deprecated legacy alias in live prose.
- Exact acceptance checks represented:
  - All coverage_row_ids listed on this target are represented without broad summary substitution.
  - All source_obligation_ids, source_seed_ids, and source_shard_ids are preserved in packet metadata.
  - Rows marked missing or partial receive concrete prose or structural additions under the mapped live anchor.
  - All exact_stale_tokens_to_retire are removed, reframed as explicitly deprecated, or preserved only as documented legacy aliases.
- Source lineage is preserved in packet metadata for coverage rows, source obligations, source seeds, source shards, gaps, fidelity refs, span group, and writer role.

### 16.1 Iced View to Slint Location

| (new) | `panels/file_manager_panel.slint` (Side panel) | New panel |

### 16.2 Widget Migration

All 25 current Iced widgets map to Slint equivalents. Key differences:
- **Canvas-based widgets** (pixel_grid, paper_texture, step_circle, budget_donut, usage_chart): Use `SharedPixelBuffer` + `Image` instead of Iced's `canvas::Program`
- **text_editor::Content** (for read-only terminal/log display): Use Slint's `TextEdit` (read-only mode) or custom `ListView` with styled text lines
- **Subscriptions** (50ms polling): Replace with event-driven `invoke_from_event_loop`
- **Context menu:** Custom implementation (Slint has no built-in)
- **Animations** (page transitions, pulsing status dots): Use Slint's property transitions and `animate` keyword
- **Dynamic scaling** (UI scale 0.75-1.5): Use Slint's native global/window scale factor as the only scaling path; do not port Iced token-multiplication layers into Slint view code

### 16.3 Data Type Preservation

All current data types (AppTheme, Page, CurrentItem, ProgressState, OutputLine, BudgetDisplayInfo, DoctorCheckResult, etc.) remain in Rust. Only their Slint representations (via properties and models) change. The backend event system, orchestrator state, and persistence remain unchanged.

### 16.4 Clipboard Migration Gate

Clipboard migration gate status is **PASS** only when all required criteria below are true.

**Pass/Fail criteria (all REQUIRED):**
- [ ] Native Copy/Paste/Select All behavior works in File Editor input, chat composer input, and terminal command input (if editable).
- [ ] Read-only terminal/log output supports selection/copy and does not accept editable paste behavior.
- [ ] No custom text-widget clipboard handler remains in the migration target.
- [ ] Non-text copy exceptions remain explicitly scoped to `ClipboardHelper` path/value contexts only.
- [ ] Rebuild branch passes type/build verification.
ContractRef: ContractName:Plans/FinalGUISpec.md#10.9.1, ContractName:Plans/DRY_Rules.md#7, SchemaID:Spec_Lock.json#locked_decisions.ui

**Verification command (build):**
```bash
cd puppet-master-rs
cargo check
```

**Scenario checklist (manual or automated GUI harness):**

| Scenario | Expected result |
|----------|-----------------|
| Editor clipboard shortcuts + context menu | Ctrl/Cmd+A/C/X/V and context Copy/Paste/Select All behave natively |
| Chat composer clipboard shortcuts + context menu | Same behavior and parity as editor |
| Terminal command input clipboard actions | Native clipboard behavior on editable command input |
| Terminal/log read-only output copy/paste behavior | Selection/copy works; paste is not treated as editable insertion |
| Non-text Copy Path/Copy Value | Clipboard receives exact path/value via `ClipboardHelper` only |
