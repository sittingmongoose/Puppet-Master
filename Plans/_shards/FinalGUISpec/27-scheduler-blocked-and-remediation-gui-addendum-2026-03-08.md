## Scheduler, blocked, and Remediation GUI Addendum (2026-03-08)

### 1. Dashboard cards

The Dashboard must distinguish:
- `wizard_attention_required`
- `wizard_blocked`
- HITL blocked actions
- remote-side-effect blocked actions

`wizard_blocked` card requirements:
- more severe copy than `wizard_attention_required`
- primary CTA: `Resume Wizard`
- secondary CTA: `View report`
- auto-dismiss only when the wizard leaves `blocked`

### 2. Assistant thread selector / badges

Thread status must include a distinct `blocked` presentation rather than overloading `attention_required`.

### 3. Run Graph and Orchestrator views

Required visible scheduler/remediation data:
- wake reason
- ready/blocked/backoff/remediation counts
- selected-node score breakdown
- ready-but-unselected reasons
- safe-point ID
- remediation lineage identifiers

### 4. blocked outcome copy

When a remote side effect or guard prevents execution, the GUI MUST present the outcome as `blocked`, not `failed`, and must preserve any completed local work.

### 5. Event-driven correctness

All scheduler/remediation/blocked UI updates must follow the existing `invoke_from_event_loop` event-driven rule. No timer polling for correctness.

### 6. Acceptance criteria

- Dashboard has a first-class `wizard_blocked` card.
- Thread badges distinguish `blocked` from `attention_required`.
- Scheduler/remediation state is inspectable in run surfaces.
- blocked outcomes are not mislabeled as failures.
- new runtime widgets obey the event-driven rewrite rule.
