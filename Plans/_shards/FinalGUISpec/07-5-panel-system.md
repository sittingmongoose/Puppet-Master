## 5. Panel System

### 5.1 Detachable Panels
**Side-panel occupancy contract (one at a time; last-click wins):** The side panel is the single activity-bar-driven side-panel slot. Run & Debug, Git (GitHub), Docker Manage, Source Control, Unraid, Artifacts, Chat, and File Manager can occupy it one at a time. See §4.1 Activity Bar for which icon shows which panel. Detach and re-dock support is limited to the panels and shell surfaces listed below.

ContractRef: ContractName:Plans/FileManager.md, ContractName:Plans/Section15_MVP_Promoted_Features_Spec.md, ContractName:Plans/storage-plan.md

The following surfaces support detach and re-dock:
- **Chat panel**
- **File Manager panel**
- **Primary terminal section**
- **Secondary terminal section** when opened

Other views (Dashboard, Settings, Orchestrator, Source Control, and similar page surfaces) remain in the primary content area and are not generic detachable panels.

### Terminal section presentation rules
- the primary terminal section defaults to the bottom runtime zone
- the product may expose a second terminal section either as an additional docked runtime section or as a detached runtime window, but it remains the same canonical terminal-section concept in both cases
- Output, Problems, Debug Console, and Ports follow the owning terminal or dev-session context; they do not become separately detached mini-shells
- detaching a terminal section preserves its section identity, tab order, pane tree, and linked session bindings
- re-docking a terminal section restores it without minting new terminal-session identity

### 5.2 Panel State Machine

Per panel: **DOCKED** <-> **FLOATING**. Same Slint component is used inline when docked or as the root of a separate Slint `Window` when floating.

```
DOCKED --[undock]--> FLOATING --[snap to edge]--> DOCKED
  |                       |
  +--[drag to edge]-------+
                          +--[close floating window]--> DOCKED (collapsed)
```

**State per panel:**

```rust
enum PanelDock {
    Docked { side: DockSide, width_px: i32 },
    Floating { window_id: WindowId, x: i32, y: i32, width: i32, height: i32 },
}

enum DockSide {
    Right,   // default for Chat and File Manager
    Left,    // alternative
    Bottom,  // for the bottom runtime zone / terminal-section host
}
```

### 5.3 Undock Triggers

- **Double-click** the panel's title bar tab
- **Drag** the panel's title bar tab away from the edge
- **Pop-out button** in panel header (window-with-arrow icon)
- **Right-click** panel tab -> "Pop out to window"
- **Keyboard shortcut** (e.g., `Ctrl+Shift+\`)
- **Command palette:** "pop out chat" or "detach file manager"

### 5.4 Snap Zones

When a floating panel window is dragged near the main window edge:
- Proximity threshold: 25px from the main window edge
- Visual cue: 2px accent strip (`Theme.accent-blue`) on the target edge
- On drop: panel docks to that side; floating window closes
- Snap animation: instant (no easing -- retro hard-edge aesthetic)

### 5.5 Slint Multi-Window Implementation

- Each panel is a reusable Slint component that renders identically whether inline (docked) or in a separate `Window` (floating)
- When docked: component placed inside main window layout hierarchy
- When floating: new Slint `Window` created; panel component placed inside it
- **Shared data:** All panel data (chat messages, file tree) lives in Rust (e.g., `Arc<RwLock<...>>`). Exposed to Slint via properties/Models (e.g., `VecModel`). Both docked and floating instances bind to the same Rust-backed properties via `Rc<VecModel<T>>` and Slint's `ModelNotify` for automatic propagation
- **Scalar properties** (orchestrator status, current phase, theme mode): Sync via `invoke_from_event_loop` from background threads -- NOT via polling timers

### 5.6 Discoverability

Three-signal system for panel detach discovery:
1. **Drag handle + tooltip:** Subtle grip icon (6 dots) in panel header. Hover tooltip: "Drag to detach, or double-click to pop out."
2. **Explicit "Pop Out" button:** Small window-with-arrow icon button in panel header (right side)
3. **First-run hint (one-time):** On first use of Chat or File Manager, inline banner: "This panel can be popped out into its own window. [Try it] [Dismiss]." Dismissed permanently after first interaction.

### 5.7 Panel Persistence
**Layout persistence per project:** Panel dock state (docked side and width, or floating position/size), **activity bar icon order**, and **which panel was last visible** are persisted **per project** in redb (e.g. under keys scoped by `project_id`). Restored on startup and when switching projects. If a floating window was on a monitor no longer connected, fall back to docked state.
### 5.8 Panel Edge Cases and Recovery

**Data sync:** Floating and docked instances share the same `Rc<VecModel<T>>` and scalar properties. When the Rust side replaces an entire model (e.g., project switch), it must update the shared `Rc` in-place rather than reassigning the pointer, so both windows stay synchronized.

**Monitor disconnect:** On startup, validate floating window coordinates against available monitors. If coordinates are off-screen or on a disconnected monitor, fall back to docked state. At runtime, listen for display-change events (platform-specific) and re-dock any orphaned floating windows.

**Snap zone conflicts:** If two floating panels are both within 25px of the same edge, the one closer to the edge wins. If equidistant, the most recently moved panel snaps first.

**Focus management:** When a floating panel window closes (user clicks X or presses Escape), focus returns to the main window. Tab key does NOT cross window boundaries -- each window has its own focus chain.

**Zero-width prevention:** Minimum panel width is 240px. If a resize drag would reduce below this, clamp at 240px. Bottom panel minimum height is 80px (collapse to 24px header via collapse button only, not via resize drag).
