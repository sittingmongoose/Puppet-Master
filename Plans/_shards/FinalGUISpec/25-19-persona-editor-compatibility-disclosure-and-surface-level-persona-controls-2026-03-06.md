## 19. Persona Editor, Compatibility Disclosure, and Surface-Level Persona Controls (2026-03-06)

### Reconciliation addendum

This addendum applies row-level transfer coverage requirements for the mapped owner anchor. Source IDs and exact source tokens are preserved in packet metadata; prose below uses canonical wording for retired legacy terms.

- Required structural headings for this packet target:
  - ### Reconciliation addendum

#### Source target target-0253
- Reconciliation action: insert_after
- Replace scope: insert_only
- Required structural headings represented:
  - ### Reconciliation addendum
- Exact required items represented:
  - `Provider_OpenCode.md` and `Provider_Stream_Mapping_External_Reference_A2A.md` both assume runtime/account disclosure obligations that their current event/API mappings cannot actually satisfy.
  - Provider_OpenCode.md
  - Provider_Stream_Mapping_External_Reference_A2A.md
  - must use progressive disclosure rather than fully expanded seam/package/node trees
  - provider/runtime disclosure fields:
- Exact acceptance checks represented:
  - All coverage_row_ids listed on this target are represented without broad summary substitution.
  - All source_obligation_ids, source_seed_ids, and source_shard_ids are preserved in packet metadata.
  - Rows marked missing or partial receive concrete prose or structural additions under the mapped live anchor.
- Source lineage is preserved in packet metadata for coverage rows, source obligations, source seeds, source shards, gaps, fidelity refs, span group, and writer role.

This addendum expands the GUI contract for Persona authoring and runtime visibility.

### 19.1 Persona editor compatibility matrix (required)

The Persona editor MUST show provider support state for Persona controls.

Support states:
- `supported`
- `partially supported`
- `unsupported`

For each control (platform/model/variant/temperature/top_p/reasoning_effort/talkativeness/tool-permission coupling/subagents), the editor must:
- show normal editing when supported,
- show warning styling and explanatory tooltip when partially supported,
- show disabled control plus explanation when unsupported.

`talkativeness` is a Persona instruction-layer control rather than a transport/runtime sampling knob. Its support state follows Persona prompt-body support: if a provider can apply Persona prompt instructions, it can apply `talkativeness`.

Minimum provider rows to display:
- Claude Code
- Cursor CLI
- OpenCode
- Direct/API providers

### 19.2 Persona editor fields (expanded)

In addition to existing Persona fields, the editor must support:
- `default_platform`
- `default_model`
- `default_variant`
- `temperature`
- `top_p`
- `reasoning_effort`
- `talkativeness`
- `preferred_tools`
- `discouraged_tools`
- `tool_usage_guidance`
- `aliases`

`talkativeness` must be rendered as a fixed single-select with these labels and stored enum values:
- `Talk a lot more` -> `talk_a_lot_more`
- `Talk more` -> `talk_more`
- `Talk a little more` -> `talk_a_little_more`
- `Model default` -> `model_default`
- `Talk a little less` -> `talk_a_little_less`
- `Talk less` -> `talk_less`

### 19.3 Compatibility panel copy examples

### Reconciliation addendum

This addendum applies row-level transfer coverage requirements for the mapped owner anchor. Source IDs and exact source tokens are preserved in packet metadata; prose below uses canonical wording for retired legacy terms.

- Required structural headings for this packet target:
  - ### Reconciliation addendum

#### Source target target-0272
- Reconciliation action: insert_after
- Replace scope: insert_only
- Required structural headings represented:
  - ### Reconciliation addendum
- Exact required items represented:
  - `request_id` still competes with `blocked_sequence` in HITL/storage examples
  - request_id
  - blocked_sequence
  - its examples still include `tier_id` / `tier_type`
  - tier_id
  - tier_type
  - Reconcile event-family names and examples that still teach `tier_id` / `tier_type` as canonical scope anchors.
- Exact acceptance checks represented:
  - All coverage_row_ids listed on this target are represented without broad summary substitution.
  - All source_obligation_ids, source_seed_ids, and source_shard_ids are preserved in packet metadata.
  - Rows marked missing or partial receive concrete prose or structural additions under the mapped live anchor.
- Source lineage is preserved in packet metadata for coverage rows, source obligations, source seeds, source shards, gaps, fidelity refs, span group, and writer role.

The editor should be able to communicate states like:
- `Claude Code: supports model preference and effort; temperature/top_p not exposed in official CLI settings.`
- `Cursor CLI: supports prompt/rules steering and some model selection; low-level runtime controls are limited or undocumented.`
- `Direct/API providers: strongest support for exact runtime controls.`

### 19.4 Surface-level Persona controls

This section consumes the linked owner contract and stays aligned with it.

Core rules:
- Runtime identity canon must preserve requested and effective naming and the account/provider identity fields, and must retire local _id substitutes.

Rules:
- requested_persona
- effective_persona
- effective_account_label
### 19.5 Runtime display requirements

When a run is active, the UI must display:
- requested Persona when explicitly set,
- effective Persona,
- selection source/reason,
- effective platform,
- effective model,
- effective variant/effort when present,
- skipped Persona controls when applicable.

This display requirement applies to:
- chat status strip or header,
- interview activity card,
- requirements builder progress/status UI,
- orchestrator activity and run inspection surfaces,
- subagent inline blocks,
- multi-pass reviewer status rows.

### 19.6 Natural-language invocation feedback

If the user summons a Persona via natural language, the UI must reflect it explicitly, for example:
- `Persona: Collaborator (User requested)`
- `Persona: Explorer (User requested, session lock)`

If the override is turn-scoped, the UI should clear back to the previous/auto state on the next eligible turn.

### 19.7 Provider-gap disclosure rule

### Reconciliation addendum

This addendum applies row-level transfer coverage requirements for the mapped owner anchor. Source IDs and exact source tokens are preserved in packet metadata; prose below uses canonical wording for retired legacy terms.

- Required structural headings for this packet target:
  - ### Reconciliation addendum

#### Source target target-0274
- Reconciliation action: insert_after
- Replace scope: insert_only
- Required structural headings represented:
  - ### Reconciliation addendum
- Exact required items represented:
  - There is still no shared rule for when an export is just a convenience view versus when it becomes a structured bundle with manifest, canonical refs, trust disclosure, and reproducibility expectations.
- Exact acceptance checks represented:
  - All coverage_row_ids listed on this target are represented without broad summary substitution.
  - All source_obligation_ids, source_seed_ids, and source_shard_ids are preserved in packet metadata.
  - Rows marked missing or partial receive concrete prose or structural additions under the mapped live anchor.
- Source lineage is preserved in packet metadata for coverage rows, source obligations, source seeds, source shards, gaps, fidelity refs, span group, and writer role.

The GUI must never imply that a provider honored a Persona control when it did not.

If a control is skipped, the UI must disclose it in at least one of:
- inline status text,
- tooltip,
- activity detail popover,
- run detail/history panel.

#### 19.7.1 Disclosure mechanics

- **Honored** = requested control applied as requested. **Skipped** = ignored entirely. **Clamped** = partially honored but changed to a supported value/range.
- Every disclosure must include: control name, requested value, effective value (if any), and human-readable reason.
- When a limitation is known before execution, render the control disabled or warning-badged in place; do not let the user believe it is actionable.
- When a limitation is only discovered at runtime, surface the disclosure inline on the active surface **and** persist the same information in run detail/history so it is auditable later.
- Disclosures must name the provider explicitly (for example: `Claude Code ignored reasoning_effort=high; provider does not support that control on this model`).

### 19.8 Interview/Builder/Orchestrator mapping editors

Settings or surface-specific configuration must support mapping Persona defaults to:
- Interview stages/phases,
- Requirements Builder steps/passes,
- Orchestrator node/package/lane/seam mappings,
- Multi-Pass review passes.

These editors should also allow platform/model selection per mapping and show compatibility warnings.

### 19.9 Acceptance criteria addendum

- Persona editor must disclose unsupported and partially supported controls per provider.
- All interactive run surfaces must show effective Persona/model/platform and selection reason.
- Natural-language Persona requests must be visibly reflected in the UI when active.
- Provider-gap disclosure must be explicit; no silent implied support.
