## 17. Persona Editor, Compatibility Disclosure, and Surface-Level Persona Controls (2026-03-06)

This addendum expands the GUI contract for Persona authoring and runtime visibility.

### 17.1 Persona editor compatibility matrix (required)

The Persona editor MUST show provider support state for Persona controls.

Support states:
- `supported`
- `partially supported`
- `unsupported`

For each control (platform/model/variant/temperature/top_p/reasoning_effort/tool-permission coupling/subagents), the editor must:
- show normal editing when supported,
- show warning styling and explanatory tooltip when partially supported,
- show disabled control plus explanation when unsupported.

Minimum provider rows to display:
- Claude Code
- Cursor CLI
- OpenCode
- Direct/API providers

### 17.2 Persona editor fields (expanded)

In addition to existing Persona fields, the editor must support:
- `default_platform`
- `default_model`
- `default_variant`
- `temperature`
- `top_p`
- `reasoning_effort`
- `preferred_tools`
- `discouraged_tools`
- `tool_usage_guidance`
- `aliases`

### 17.3 Compatibility panel copy examples

The editor should be able to communicate states like:
- `Claude Code: supports model preference and effort; temperature/top_p not exposed in official CLI settings.`
- `Cursor CLI: supports prompt/rules steering and some model selection; low-level runtime controls are limited or undocumented.`
- `Direct/API providers: strongest support for exact runtime controls.`

### 17.4 Surface-level Persona controls

Persona controls are required on the following surfaces:
- Chat
- Interview
- Requirements Builder
- Orchestrator
- Multi-Pass Review

Each surface should expose, at minimum:
- Persona mode (`Auto` / `Manual` / `Hybrid`)
- current effective Persona display
- platform/model display
- selection reason
- manual override control or lock/unlock affordance

### 17.5 Runtime display requirements

When a run is active, the UI must display:
- requested Persona when explicitly set,
- effective Persona,
- selection source/reason,
- effective platform,
- effective model,
- effective variant/effort when present,
- skipped Persona controls when applicable.

This display requirement applies to:
- chat status strip or header,
- interview activity card,
- requirements builder progress/status UI,
- orchestrator activity and run inspection surfaces,
- subagent inline blocks,
- multi-pass reviewer status rows.

### 17.6 Natural-language invocation feedback

If the user summons a Persona via natural language, the UI must reflect it explicitly, for example:
- `Persona: Collaborator (User requested)`
- `Persona: Explorer (User requested, session lock)`

If the override is turn-scoped, the UI should clear back to the previous/auto state on the next eligible turn.

### 17.7 Provider-gap disclosure rule

The GUI must never imply that a provider honored a Persona control when it did not.

If a control is skipped, the UI must disclose it in at least one of:
- inline status text,
- tooltip,
- activity detail popover,
- run detail/history panel.

### 17.8 Interview/Builder/Orchestrator mapping editors

Settings or surface-specific configuration must support mapping Persona defaults to:
- Interview stages/phases,
- Requirements Builder steps/passes,
- Orchestrator phase/task/subtask/iteration tiers,
- Multi-Pass review passes.

These editors should also allow platform/model selection per mapping and show compatibility warnings.

### 17.9 Acceptance criteria addendum

- Persona editor must disclose unsupported and partially supported controls per provider.
- All interactive run surfaces must show effective Persona/model/platform and selection reason.
- Natural-language Persona requests must be visibly reflected in the UI when active.
- Provider-gap disclosure must be explicit; no silent implied support.
