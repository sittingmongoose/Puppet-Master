## 7. Views Specification

### 7.1 Orchestrator
Orchestrator is the operational surface for rewrite-era execution.

Rules:
- Orchestrator remains tab-first with `Progress`, `Seams`, `Node Graph`, `Evidence`, `History`, and `Ledger`
- only `Progress` is widget-composed
- `Seams`, `Node Graph`, `Evidence`, `History`, and `Ledger` are native views

ContractRef: ContractName:Plans/Orchestrator_Page.md, ContractName:Plans/Widget_System.md, ContractName:Plans/Crosswalk.md

### 7.2 Source Control
Source Control is a narrow, compact, worktree-first panel.

Rules:
- rows are concrete worktrees/branches/paths
- package, lane, and run context appear as metadata rather than as the primary grouping axis
- Git-native actions remain in Source Control, not in Orchestrator

ContractRef: ContractName:Plans/WorktreeGitImprovement.md, ContractName:Plans/GitHub_Integration.md, ContractName:Plans/FileManager.md

### 7.3 Shared route and open behavior
Views consume the canonical navigation/source-open primitives.

Rules:
- routed opens resolve through `route_target`
- source opens resolve through `OpenSubject` or `OpenFile` as appropriate
- `resume_url` is serialized transport only and must not outgrow the canonical route contract
- shell realization such as docked/floating state, widths, and local panel layout remains shell state rather than route identity

#### Thread context detail realization

Thread context details are a reusable editor-tab surface rather than a chat-side-panel usage view.

Rules:
- `More Details` from the chat context hover module opens or focuses a thread-scoped Context Detail Pane in the editor-tab host
- there is one open Context Detail Pane tab per thread; repeated opens focus the existing tab
- route selection reveals the correct shell destination and focus target
- generated-document or subject realization for the tab follows the canonical route/open split rather than a chat-local special case
- the shell must not treat a detached pop-out or side-panel usage panel as the canonical destination for this surface

### 7.4 Settings and inspectors
Settings and inspectors separate:
- inherited / overridden
- requested
- effective
- honored / skipped / clamped

Rules:
- detailed runtime identity inspectors must show provider, model, persona, account, and worker-policy requested/effective state
- compact surfaces may show only material deltas
- historical views use frozen captured state and do not recompute from current settings
- chat-facing compact rows and popovers are compact surfaces, not the full detailed inspector tier

ContractRef: ContractName:Plans/Prompt_Pipeline.md, ContractName:Plans/Models_System.md, ContractName:Plans/Multi-Account.md

Chat runtime-inspector rules:
- the message-under-row compact summary shows resolved mode label, model, and assistant duration or user timestamp
- the message info popover shows `Mode`, `Provider`, `Model`, `Effort`, `Persona`, `Worker`, `Tokens`, and `Context`
- compact chat-facing surfaces omit version and omit `current` / `frozen` wording
- the fuller requested/effective/runtime disclosure tier lives in the Context Detail Pane and other detailed inspectors

ContractRef: ContractName:Plans/assistant-chat-design.md, ContractName:Plans/Contracts_V0.md, ContractName:Plans/usage-feature.md

Context Detail Pane inspector rules:
- default view is curated, with a visible raw toggle
- curated view exposes overview, breakdown, and per-message inspection
- raw view exposes thread-level and message-level serialized payloads suitable for debugging, audits, and provider/runtime inspection
- thread-scoped estimated cost and token/context summaries must stay aligned with the canonical usage pipeline

### 7.5 Project and attention surfaces
Project cards and the attention center consume project-summary and project-attention projections.

Rules:
- project cards surface activity, attention, and health separately
- blocked ownership is summarized by the strongest active item when one exists
- attention rows, palette opens, and cross-surface pivots resolve through the same internal route contract
