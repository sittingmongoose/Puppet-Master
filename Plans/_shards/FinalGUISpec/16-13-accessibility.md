## 13. Accessibility

### 13.1 Basic Theme as Accessibility Option

The Basic theme is the primary accessibility-friendly option:
- No decorative effects (pixel grid, paper texture, scanlines)
- WCAG AA compliant color palette (4.5:1 minimum contrast for all text)
- System fonts designed for screen readability
- Minimum 14px body text, 1.6 line height, 0.02em letter spacing
- 4px border radius (less visually harsh)
- No hard shadows
- Respects `prefers-reduced-motion` (no animations or transitions)

### 13.2 Focus Indicators

### Reconciliation addendum

This addendum applies row-level transfer coverage requirements for the mapped owner anchor. Source IDs and exact source tokens are preserved in packet metadata; prose below uses canonical wording for retired legacy terms.

- Required structural headings for this packet target:
  - ### Reconciliation addendum

#### Source target target-0266
- Reconciliation action: insert_after
- Replace scope: insert_only
- Required structural headings represented:
  - ### Reconciliation addendum
- Exact required items represented:
  - others should be transient focus changes only
  - `inspector_target` is still useful, but it should stay for reusable detail-pane or subsection focus, not as a universal dumping ground for all feature-local anchors.
  - inspector_target
  - `inspector_target` for reusable detail-surface focus
  - Canonical identity and UI focus are different layers.
  - Use `inspector_target = evidence` when the target object is already selected and the detail focus must land on evidence.
  - inspector_target = evidence
  - Define `tab_id` as stable page-tab focus only.
  - tab_id
- Exact acceptance checks represented:
  - All coverage_row_ids listed on this target are represented without broad summary substitution.
  - All source_obligation_ids, source_seed_ids, and source_shard_ids are preserved in packet metadata.
  - Rows marked missing or partial receive concrete prose or structural additions under the mapped live anchor.
- Source lineage is preserved in packet metadata for coverage rows, source obligations, source seeds, source shards, gaps, fidelity refs, span group, and writer role.

All themes must show visible focus indicators:
- **Retro Dark/Light:** ACID_LIME 2px border on focus
- **Basic:** High-contrast 2px ring with 2px offset in accent-blue

### 13.3 Keyboard Navigation

- All interactive elements reachable via Tab navigation
- Focus order follows visual layout: Activity bar -> primary content -> side panel -> bottom panel -> status bar
- Every list, table, and tree supports: Up/Down arrow navigation, Enter to select/activate, Escape to deselect/go back, Home/End to jump to first/last item
- Type-ahead filtering where appropriate (thread list, project list, file tree)

### 13.4 Screen Reader Support

Slint's screen reader support is limited. Mitigations:
- Set `accessible-role` and `accessible-label` properties on all interactive components where available in Slint 1.15.1
- Panel state (docked/floating) announced via accessible labels
- Theme name available to assistive technology
- Keyboard shortcuts prominently documented and discoverable via command palette

### 13.5 Minimum Touch/Click Targets

All clickable/draggable controls must be at least 24px in height/width for reliable interaction.
