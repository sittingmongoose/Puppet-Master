# Decision Log


> **Compliance:** This document follows `Plans/DRY_Rules.md` and references SSOT contracts in `Plans/Contracts_V0.md`. Naming: "Puppet Master" only. No open questions; deterministic defaults per `Plans/Decision_Policy.md`.

## Purpose
Records decisions made during plan document updates that are not captured in `Plans/auto_decisions.jsonl` or `Plans/Decision_Policy.md`. Each entry is timestamped and final.

Decision_Log is a human-authored decision ledger, not a derived decision log. `Plans/auto_decisions.jsonl` is pipeline-managed and must not be hand-edited here; `Plans/.pipeline/research_packet.json` (`/.pipeline/research_packet.json`) is regenerated after owner/consumer reconciliation and must not be treated as fidelity-complete Decision_Log canon.

## Entries


### DL-001: OpenCode Deep Extraction — SSOT target mapping for new subsystems
The mapping captured in `OpenCode_Deep_Extraction.md` remains a reference aid, but local canonical contracts still control final ownership in Puppet Master.

### DL-002: Section numbering shift in OpenCode_Deep_Extraction.md
Section-number drift in the extraction source must not become canonical drift in local SSOT docs.

### DL-003: Orchestrator execution model
The canonical orchestration model is the node graph. `Feature Seam` and `Work Package` are first-class graph-owned objects, and `Node` remains the smallest executable unit.

ContractRef: ContractName:Plans/Executor_Protocol.md, ContractName:Plans/Orchestrator_Page.md

### DL-004: Governance split
`Package Overseer` and `Seam Overseer` are distinct governance roles. Runtime remains the canonical owner of readiness, blockers, transitions, retries, and dispatch.

ContractRef: ContractName:Plans/Executor_Protocol.md, ContractName:Plans/orchestrator-subagent-integration.md

### DL-005: Completion and promotion model
`Locally Complete`, `Available to Seam`, and `Seam Complete` remain distinct. Package completion alone is insufficient.

ContractRef: ContractName:Plans/Orchestrator_Page.md, ContractName:Plans/Run_Graph_View.md

### DL-006: Weak integration
Weak integration remains first-class and includes runtime/GUI mismatch, contract mismatch, workflow gaps, and architecture drift.

ContractRef: ContractName:Plans/Orchestrator_Page.md, ContractName:Plans/Glossary.md

### DL-007: Corroboration threshold
High-impact claims use deterministic `2-of-3` corroboration. Lesser unresolved concerns remain visible as non-blocking advisory concerns.

ContractRef: ContractName:Plans/Orchestrator_Page.md, ContractName:Plans/Decision_Policy.md

### DL-008: Graph patch lineage


Graph patching creates a new graph generation and preserves superseded historical paths as visible lineage.

ContractRef: ContractName:Plans/Run_Graph_View.md, ContractName:Plans/storage-plan.md

### DL-009: Source Control boundary
Source Control is worktree-first and compact. Orchestrator carries lane/package/seam operational context.

ContractRef: ContractName:Plans/WorktreeGitImprovement.md, ContractName:Plans/GitHub_Integration.md

### DL-010: Shared runtime identity
Requested/effective runtime identity is shared across assistant, interviewer, builders, overseers, and node workers without collapsing those actors into one ontology.

ContractRef: ContractName:Plans/Prompt_Pipeline.md, ContractName:Plans/Multi-Account.md

### DL-011: Blocked approval identity
Blocked episodes anchored by `run_id`, `node_id`, `blocked_sequence`, and `attempt_id?` supersede request-centric HITL identity as canonical runtime approval scope.

ContractRef: ContractName:Plans/Contracts_V0.md, ContractName:Plans/human-in-the-loop.md

### DL-012: Navigation primitives


`route_target` is the canonical navigation contract. `OpenSubject` is the canonical identity-native source-open contract. `resume_url` is serialized transport only.

ContractRef: ContractName:Plans/Crosswalk.md, ContractName:Plans/FileManager.md

### DL-013: Debug evidence capture hygiene
Debug instrumentation and investigation evidence follow a non-citation operational ledger rule: secrets in logs, PII, and diff fatigue must be planned for up front, and downstream captures should use allowlisted log shapes or structured fields rather than free-form dump capture.

ContractRef: ContractName:Plans/Contracts_V0.md, ContractName:Plans/Architecture_Invariants.md, ContractName:Plans/Runtime_Artifacts_Panel.md

### DL-014: Shared provider-runtime actor envelope
The shared provider-runtime contract applies beyond Orchestrator: `Multi-Account.md` governs assistant, interviewer, requirements builder, PRD builder, overseers, node workers, and provider-backed chat/tool turns. Requested and effective `/model/effort/persona/auth/account`, `/effective` identity, provider-runtime selection reason, `/tool` context, and PRD/account lineage are shared runtime concepts. A first-class actor envelope is required for non-run auditability and replay: `Models_System.md` keeps provider/model/variant selection, `Prompt_Pipeline.md` carries `actor_kind` and `execution_role`, and `storage-plan.md` must not key provider account snapshots only by `run_id` when `/runtime` actors include assistant, interviewer, builders, overseers, and node workers.

ContractRef: ContractName:Plans/Multi-Account.md, ContractName:Plans/Models_System.md, ContractName:Plans/Prompt_Pipeline.md, ContractName:Plans/storage-plan.md

### DL-015: Support decision drift and sharding settings
Supporting planning machinery is not exempt from decision traceability: `Plans/sharding_config.json` (`/sharding_config.json`) and `Plans/auto_decisions.jsonl` (`/auto_decisions.jsonl`) must not disagree on fallback `chunk-line` settings, because `/decision` state drift in support files can still corrupt owner/consumer reconciliation.

ContractRef: ContractName:Plans/DRY_Rules.md, ContractName:Plans/Decision_Policy.md

### DL-016: Governance labels, completion states, and copy boundaries
Canonical copy favors precise runtime and user-facing labels. Object/action labels include `Seams`, `Feature Seam`, `Work Package`, `Package Overseer`, `Seam Overseer`, `Locally Complete`, `Seam Complete`, `Completion Blocked`, `Weak Integration`, `Promotion Blocked`, `Promotion Revoked`, `Corroboration Requested`, `Challenge Accepted`, `Challenge Not Accepted`, `Advisory Concern Recorded`, `Graph Patch Requested`, `Graph Patch Applied`, and `Generation Updated`; `/labels`, `/action`, `/runtime`, and `/object` consumers must not invent alternate peer terms.

Governance semantics stay graph-owned: a `run` is the full canonical graph under deterministic runtime control, a `work package` is a coherent precomputed subgraph with a local overseer, a `feature seam` is a cross-package oversight scope, and a `node` is the smallest executable work unit. Overseers may critique or challenge package outcomes, but newly discovered work becomes explicit remediation nodes or graph-patch requests; `/corroboration` agents may be used before accepting high-impact, cross-package challenge gaps, and seam completion requires integration quality rather than package-local pass states alone.

ContractRef: ContractName:Plans/Orchestrator_Page.md, ContractName:Plans/Run_Graph_View.md, ContractName:Plans/Decision_Policy.md

### DL-017: Seam visibility, weak integration, and reopen policy
Weak integration is not just a badge. Seams UI must summarize weak integration visibly and group concerns under readable headings such as Wiring, Workflow, State, GUI, and Design. Package issues roll up to seam concerns only when they cross package-to-seam, `/seam/user-visible`, or user-visible boundaries or affect seam completion truth. `Locally Complete`, `Available to Seam`, and `Seam Complete` remain distinct from `Lane to Package`, `Package to Seam`, and `Seam Completion` promotion boundaries.

Revocation and reopen semantics are explicit named states: `Promotion Revoked`, `Seam Completion Revoked`, `Reopened`, `Reopened by Patch`, and `Reopened by New Evidence`. Blocked states expose blocked reason, blocked owner, and recovery context. Weak-integration buckets include missing GUI representation of runtime/governance state, state-model mismatch across package boundaries, user-flow dead ends or partial affordances, contract drift, duplicated interpretation across packages, technically passing local checks while seam-level UX or architecture remains poor, GUI/runtime mismatch, incomplete end-to-end flow, cross-package state mismatch, local-pass/global-fail composition, missing degraded `/recovery` behavior, inconsistent UX semantics, cross-seam architecture drift, and invisible governance or missing operator affordances. `Decision_Policy` needs first-class policy objects and transitions for concerns, corroboration, promotions, and superseded `/revoked/reopened` states.

ContractRef: ContractName:Plans/Orchestrator_Page.md, ContractName:Plans/Run_Graph_View.md, ContractName:Plans/Decision_Policy.md, ContractName:Plans/Glossary.md

### DL-018: Approval anchoring and evidence-schema governance
Approval anchoring moves to canonical runtime identity: `run_id`, `node_id`, `blocked_sequence`, optional `attempt_id`, and execution-unit context refs supersede request-centric button copy, request-centric persistence language, and tier-boundary approval `CTA` framing in `Plans/human-in-the-loop.md` (`/human-in-the-loop.md`). Gate/evidence schema mismatch is a first-class governance defect, not just a tooling gap, and `/evidence` contracts must expose the defect as such.

ContractRef: ContractName:Plans/Contracts_V0.md, ContractName:Plans/human-in-the-loop.md, ContractName:Plans/Progression_Gates.md

### DL-019: Identity migration, help clusters, and retained cleanup
Worktree and graph approval identity must stop hanging on `tier_id`, request-centric `HITL`, or `request_id` payloads once blocked-episode runtime identity is available. Replace graph HITL command payload identity with blocked-episode anchored identity while preserving `Contracts_V0.md` / `Contracts_V0` compatibility notes for the request-centric-to-blocked-episode migration.

Corroboration disagreement handling uses the `2-of-3` rule: `2-of-3` accepts a high-impact claim as `/canonical`, no `2-of-3` means a high-impact claim is not accepted as blocking or canonical truth, and credible lesser concerns still emit a non-blocking `/minor` advisory visible on the Orchestrator page.

The help system must support related-link clusters for `Feature Seam` <-> `Work Package` <-> `Weak Integration` <-> `Seam Complete`, `Promotion` <-> `Revoked` <-> `Reopened`, `Corroboration` <-> `Concern` <-> `Review`, `Graph Patch` <-> `Generation Updated` <-> `Historical Path`, `Lane` <-> `Worktree` <-> `Cleanup Eligible` <-> `Archived/Removed`, and `Requested` <-> `Effective` <-> `Skipped/Clamped`; `/Clamped` and `/Removed` remain aliases only where explicitly documented.

Lane cleanup may transition into `retained` instead of immediate cleanup when recent completion is pending review or `/promotion`, weak integration remains under investigation, unresolved concern or corroboration is tied to lane outputs, or manual operator retention is active.

### DL-027: Case L Bundle A — canonical recovery, backup, migration, downgrade, and restore

Approved on 2026-07-17. The approval source records the calendar date but not an exact UTC instant; this entry does not invent one. This grouped entry records exactly six accepted decisions:

- `PD-L-01` — Keep the eight launch-critical redb-only families canonical in redb; guarantee recovery with verified automatic snapshots rather than dual-homing them to seglog.
- `PD-L-02` — Take a verified baseline before mutation-capable startup; snapshot within five minutes of first dirty mutation, at least once per dirty 24-hour window, and at clean shutdown when dirty; retain three rolling snapshots plus protected pre-migration snapshots.
- `PD-L-03` — If a required snapshot cannot be verified, stop new mutation-capable work and enter recovery/read-only posture; diagnostics remain available.
- `PD-L-04` — A newer-format store may expose metadata-only compatibility diagnostics, but must not be opened as a live `/read-only` viewer.
- `PD-L-05` — No in-place downgrade. Downgrade is only whole-boundary restore of a backup supported by the running app, with the post-upgrade write-loss window disclosed.
- `PD-L-06` — Select restore from the startup recovery shell, execute with canonical stores offline, and do not treat JSON/JSONL exports as importable backups at MVP.

The approval consciously accepts `PD-L-01`, `PD-L-02`, `PD-L-03`, and `PD-L-04`. Storage plan owns store ceilings, migration execution, recovery snapshots, backup/restore, preflight, and alias lifecycle; the storage registry and recovery schemas are machine authorities. Release, Contracts, Architecture Invariants, Final GUI, commands/wiring, and Automated Testing consume that owner contract and must not create peer migration or recovery policy.

Negative constraints: no dual-home expansion is implied; no in-place downgrade; no live newer-store viewer; no ordinary writer/projector open on unsupported or half-migrated state; no export-as-backup import; no mutation when a required verified snapshot is unavailable; and no generated governance artifact is hand-edited from this decision record.

Acceptance is governed by all `FX-L001-*`, `FX-L002-*`, `FX-L003-*`, `FX-L016-*`, `FX-L025-*`, and `FX-L032-*` oracles in the source plan, including no-mutation tree-hash checks, crash convergence, receipt round-trip, shared-boundary restore, alias idempotence, and exact preflight/progress behavior.

### DL-028: Case L Bundle B — seglog frame, durability, corruption, recovery, and crash convergence

Approved on 2026-07-17. The approval source records the calendar date but not an exact UTC instant; this entry does not invent one. This grouped entry records exactly twenty-one accepted decisions:

- `SEG-D-001` — Begin implementation on `SeglogFrameV2`; generation 1 is compatibility-only and never mixed with V2 in one segment.
- `SEG-D-002` — Use a fixed, independently CRC-protected resynchronization prefix covering framing lengths, generation, sequence, and content CRCs.
- `SEG-D-003` — Use bounded canonical header metadata: at most 4 KiB metadata and 16 MiB inline payload; larger content uses `payload_ref`.
- `SEG-D-004` — Validate in a fixed order and resynchronize only to a candidate whose prefix, bounds, generation, monotonic sequence, metadata, payload, schema, and duplicated identities all validate.
- `SEG-D-005` — Pin exact loss units: one frame only when the next boundary validates; otherwise a byte range to the next valid frame or the segment remainder. Closed segments are never modified; acknowledged-range loss blocks mutation.
- `SEG-D-006` — Add a disk-first seglog generation manifest as the publication and recovery authority.
- `SEG-D-007` — Acknowledge append only after two durability barriers: frame bytes first, then committed manifest/watermark metadata.
- `SEG-D-008` — Permit bounded group commit for ordinary events, but force a durability barrier before any mutation-gating safe point, checkpoint marker, receipt, or approval can authorize downstream mutation.
- `SEG-D-009` — Assign `EventRecord.persisted_at_utc` at commit-group seal immediately before final frame encoding. It is not independently proof of persistence and is admissible as a durable fact only with the matching `AppendReceipt{durability_state="synced"}`; `AppendReceipt.acknowledged_at_utc` is the post-barrier acknowledgement time.
- `SEG-D-011` — Lease sequence ranges durably and never reuse an allocated sequence after crash or truncation; gaps are legal and detectable.
- `SEG-D-013` — Identify loss impact by ranked evidence from verified frame metadata/indexes, never by timestamps or speculation.
- `SEG-D-014` — Rebuild projections from the deterministic surviving-record set and retain degraded trust when acknowledged canon has a hole.
- `SEG-D-015` — Disclose lossy recovery, affected ranges/identities, trust impact, and available recovery actions; never label it clean.
- `SEG-D-016` — Emit deterministic storage-integrity and boot-recovery events with stable episode identity and no duplicate semantic episode on retry.
- `SEG-D-017` — Persist recovery intent before any destructive truncate, generation switch, or cleanup action.
- `SEG-D-018` — Rotation uses a zero-active, crash-convergent protocol; startup repairs zero/two-active states deterministically.
- `SEG-D-019` — Active-tail truncation is postcondition-driven and idempotent; acknowledged bytes are not silently discarded.
- `SEG-D-020` — Seal active midstream corruption as degraded and preserve closed bytes; do not rewrite the damaged source in place.
- `SEG-D-021` — Compaction publishes a verified successor generation through a durable manifest/pointer transition.
- `SEG-D-022` — Janitor and boot recovery are idempotent and summarize one recovery episode rather than emitting duplicate outcomes.
- `SEG-D-023` — Complete recovery before projector startup or mutation admission.

Storage plan owns framing, durability barriers, sequence allocation, survivor/recovery truth, manifest publication, rotation, truncation, and compaction. Contracts owns referenced EventRecord payload and `AppendReceipt` shapes; Architecture Invariants mirrors durability/immutability; Executor consumes mutation barriers; Final GUI and Runtime Artifacts consume truthful recovery state. No consumer may weaken or re-own storage mechanics.

Negative constraints: never acknowledge on write or buffer flush alone; never treat seal-time `persisted_at_utc` as independent durability proof; never claim one-record loss without a verified next boundary; never reuse a sequence; never mutate a closed source segment; never use timestamps as replay cursors or loss evidence; never start projectors or mutation admission before recovery convergence; and never label canonical loss clean.

Acceptance is governed by `SEG-FX-001` through `SEG-FX-018` and `SEG-OR-001` through `SEG-OR-012`, including byte-identical survivor determinism, two-barrier acknowledgement, mutation gating, sequence nonreuse, crash convergence, closed-segment immutability, checkpoint truth, degraded projection truth, recovery idempotence, directory durability, disclosure truth, and live pointer fidelity.

### DL-029: Case L Bundle C — retention, holds, compaction, deletion, and quarantine

Approved on 2026-07-17. The approval source records the calendar date but not an exact UTC instant; this entry does not invent one. This grouped entry records exactly nineteen accepted decisions:

- `PD-L005-01` — Retain approval, receipt, audit, deletion-tombstone, and source-lineage authority indefinitely; storage pressure fails closed instead of evicting it.
- `PD-L005-02` — Retain chat content while its thread exists; cap at 250,000 canonical chat-content events per thread, then roll into a linked successor rather than evict.
- `PD-L005-03` — Retain released safe points for 90 days, capped at 64 per run and 2,048 per project; held items are excluded from eviction.
- `PD-L005-04` — Run janitor at startup and every 6 hours, at most 10,000 keys or 512 MiB per pass; evaluate compaction every 24 hours and at 20% or 1 GiB reclaimable thresholds.
- `PD-L005-05` — Require `storage.legal_hold.manage` plus a reason for hold set/clear; legal holds never clear automatically.
- `PD-L005-06` — Add `Advanced > Storage & Retention` to search-first Settings; hold mutation remains a protected command.
- `PD-L005-07` — Automatically preserve the latest 25 terminal runs per project; only that automatic anchor clears when a run becomes 26th-oldest.
- `PD-L010-01` — Publish a `requires_safe_point_restore` blocked episode, safe point, snapshot refs, and recovery anchor as one durability unit.
- `PD-L010-02` — Release a recovery anchor only on `resolved`, `superseded_with_verified_successor`, or explicit `abandoned_by_user`.
- `PD-L010-03` — Missing required snapshot becomes `recovery_unavailable`; remain blocked/anchored and require explicit abandon, replan, or verified recovery.
- `PD-L015-01` — Compaction writes successor generations, preserves event/sequence identity, and never rewrites closed source segments.
- `PD-L015-02` — Publish compaction atomically by same-directory `CURRENT` pointer rename after successor files and pending redb metadata are durable.
- `PD-L015-03` — Make migration, compaction, restore, salvage, and backup-boundary capture mutually exclusive under one maintenance lease.
- `PD-L015-04` — Thread deletion is immediately logical and physically purged from active canon within 24 hours unless held; retain a content-free tombstone indefinitely.
- `PD-L015-05` — Keep “remove project from list” distinct from “delete Puppet Master project data”; only the latter compacts project content out of the shared seglog.
- `PD-L033-01` — Durably quarantine exact raw bytes plus custody metadata before reset, deletion, migration, or replacement of invalid canonical values.
- `PD-L033-02` — Only resettable GUI/projection state may quarantine then reset; authority, receipts, blocked state, safe points, and audit values fail closed.
- `PD-L033-03` — Never cap-evict unresolved critical quarantine; cap pressure blocks new mutation-capable writes.
- `PD-SCHEMA-01` — Rev the registry to `pm.storage_value_registry.v2` / `2.0.0` for structured retention fields; v1 prose is compatibility-only for one migration interval.

The approval consciously accepts `PD-L005-03` and `PD-L015-04`. Storage plan owns policy tables, hold/anchor state, janitor parameters, compaction, deletion/purge, and quarantine custody; FileSafe co-owns recovery-anchor triggers/releases. The registry/schema are machine authority; Contracts owns shared payload vocabulary; Chat, GUI, Settings, permissions, commands, and Automated Testing consume the owner contract.

Negative constraints: no authority eviction under storage pressure; no mtime/prefix-derived destructive policy; no automatic legal-hold release; no cleanup of an open recovery anchor; no active-segment or in-place closed-segment rewrite; no ambiguous project-content purge; no reset before raw custody; no critical-authority default/reset; no unresolved critical quarantine cap eviction; and no v1 prose treated as v2 machine authority.

Acceptance is governed by `RET-001` through `RET-006`, `ANCHOR-001` through `ANCHOR-005`, `CMP-001` through `CMP-006`, `DEL-001` through `DEL-004`, and `Q-001` through `Q-007`, including exact expiry/cardinality selection, hold composition, atomic blocked-anchor publication, generation swap/crash recovery, deletion SLO and tombstone behavior, and quarantine custody/cap/integrity oracles.

### DL-030: Case L Bundle D — storage I/O, locking, viewer, root continuity, relocation, and fallback

Approved on 2026-07-17. The approval source records the calendar date but not an exact UTC instant; this entry does not invent one. This grouped entry records exactly fourteen accepted decisions:

- `L012-C1` — Use a closed storage-I/O taxonomy; only `interrupted` and `transient_busy` auto-retry. Unknown codes fail closed as device-unavailable.
- `L012-C2` — Retry interrupted syscalls at most three immediate adapter attempts and transient-busy exactly once after 250 ms; no exponential/background retry for canonical writes.
- `L012-C3` — Exhausted/non-retryable canonical I/O flips the gate to viewer or blocked, retains the lock, stops all writers and mutation-capable admission, and never buffers pseudo-durable canon in memory.
- `L012-C4` — ENOSPC behavior is write-site-specific and fail-closed; recovery is an explicit `Retry storage` probe/revalidation. Use an optional 8 MiB diagnostic reserve only as best effort.
- `L014-C1` — The held OS lock is authority; PID/mtime/2-second heartbeat are diagnostics only, stale after 10 seconds, and never authorize takeover while the OS lock is held.
- `L014-C2` — Use one aggregate canonical-store lock per active root for MVP; avoid partial multi-family lock acquisition.
- `L014-C3` — Use handle-lifetime `flock` on Unix and `CreateFileW` + `LockFileEx` on Windows with one closed acquire result; unsupported semantics route to unsafe-root handling.
- `L014-C4` — Viewer is a frozen, manually refreshable snapshot with an explicit disabled-command envelope; promotion is never automatic and reruns every root/version/integrity/lock check.
- `L018-C1` — Persist both a stable out-of-root bootstrap binding and an in-root `storage_instance_id`/path-fingerprint manifest; probe before creating candidate roots.
- `L018-C2` — Root mismatch blocks writer startup and offers use previous, choose, copy-and-switch, or strongly confirmed new instance; never silently initialize or overwrite.
- `L018-C3` — Relocation is copy-validate-switch with binding update last; retain the verified source as a recovery copy.
- `L011-C1` — Use deterministic fallback `<bootstrap_root>/storage-fallbacks/<logical_root_fingerprint>/`; all canonical stores and the lock move together or fallback is refused.
- `L011-C2` — Treat fallback as a detached branch with an exact base fingerprint; detect divergence, close writes, and never claim cross-host single-writer safety.
- `L011-C3` — Return is explicit and fast-forward-only when the logical root still matches the base; otherwise no automatic merge/overwrite and both stores remain recoverable.

Storage plan owns root identities, I/O classification/recovery, aggregate locking, viewer admission/promotion, continuity/relocation, and fallback branch/reconciliation. Contracts owns shared operational-state vocabulary; Executor consumes write-admission and retry classification; Final GUI owns visible recovery/viewer/mismatch/divergence surfaces; Commands and the UI catalog/wiring consume registered actions without local authority tests.

Negative constraints: no blind retry outside the closed classes/budgets; no in-memory pseudo-durability; no canonical eviction to work around ENOSPC; no takeover from PID, mtime, heartbeat, or file existence; no writer-capable viewer subsystem or automatic promotion; no silent first-run replacement of known prior data; no raw path export; no split fallback roots; no cross-host exclusion claim; and no divergent auto-merge, overwrite, or deletion.

Acceptance is governed by every exact fixture/oracle in `LOCKING_ROOT_IO_REPAIR_PLAN.md` §§3.6, 4.6, 5.6, and 6.6: per-write-site class/retry/aftermath, ENOSPC mutation fencing, two-process Unix/Windows lock races, stale-owner takeover refusal, complete viewer command inventory and direct-handler gate, boot-before-create continuity, relocation crash boundaries, deterministic fallback location, two-host divergence, and fast-forward-only return.

### DL-031: Case L Bundle E — EventRecord application scope, legacy normalization, dedupe, and replay

Approved on 2026-07-17. The approval source records the calendar date but not an exact UTC instant; this entry does not invent one. This grouped entry records exactly seven accepted decisions:

- `EVT-01` — Add required `scope_kind = application | project`; application events carry `project_id = null`, project events a non-empty ID; never invent a fake project.
- `EVT-02` — Enforce `event_id` globally and idempotency within `(scope_partition, event_type)` for the lifetime of the app data root.
- `EVT-03` — Normalize legacy `EventEnvelopeV1` deterministically in memory for projection/replay; do not append or rewrite it.
- `EVT-04` — Quarantine legacy values containing unhandled secrets unless a registered versioned transform exists.
- `EVT-05` — Quarantine unknown scope or payload mappings rather than defaulting them.
- `EVT-06` — On dedupe-index outage, synchronously catch up through the seglog tail or fail closed without append.
- `EVT-07` — Publish EventRecord `2.0.0`; older writers never mutate it, and read-only access requires a validating 2.0 reader.

Contracts and the EventRecord schema own the closed envelope, replay policies, and event payload vocabulary; storage plan owns persistence, scope partitions, normalization formulas, dedupe lifetime/currentness, and index rebuild behavior. Storage registry/index rows and the event-family registry are machine consumers/authorities for their declared shapes; projectors and other producers must consume the owner contracts without inventing scope or compatibility behavior.

Negative constraints: no fake/default project sentinel; no ambiguous null scope; no legacy append or durable rewrite during ordinary replay; no random, read-time, path, mtime, or mutable-session normalization inputs; no heuristic secret redaction; no unknown scope/payload default; no append while dedupe currentness is unproved; no external/canonical side effect from `projector_replay_only`; and no older-writer mutation of EventRecord 2.0.

Acceptance is governed by all schema/scope, legacy-normalization, dedupe/outage, `projector_replay_only`, and version/migration fixtures in `EVENT_RECORD_REPAIR_PLAN.md` §8: exact scope-partition round-trip, byte-identical JCS/MessagePack normalization across runs, quarantine-without-checkpoint-advance negatives, store-lifetime dedupe and crash catch-up, zero side-effect spies, stable generation replay, and no 1.0 writer mutation.

### DL-032: Case L Bundle F — FileSafe restore, safe points, baseline targets, restore points, and Chat revert

Approved on 2026-07-17. The approval source records the calendar date but not an exact UTC instant; this entry does not invent one. This grouped entry records exactly nine accepted decisions:

- `PD-RSP-01` — Safe-point restore and Chat revert are exact-replace journaled operations with verified rollback and restart reconciliation; they do not merge.
- `PD-RSP-02` — Equality is a canonical manifest SHA-256 covering stated SCM identity, index, tracked/untracked, explicit mutation-scope ignored paths, and portable metadata boundaries.
- `PD-RSP-03` — Keep content-addressed snapshot manifests/blobs under the resolved storage root outside the worktree; persist only refs/hashes; remote projects keep custody on the authorized remote.
- `PD-RSP-04` — Add `restore_refused` and `restore_recovery_required`; emit `restore_failed` only after verified rollback equality.
- `PD-RSP-05` — Canonical key is `sp:{run_id}:{node_id}:{attempt_id}:{safe_point_id}`; migrate `safe_point.sp:{...}`, make `safe_point:<id>` lookup-only, and split registry families.
- `PD-RSP-06` — Persist reference-based holds for active attempts, unresolved restore-required episodes, nonterminal restore transactions, preserved runs, and legal holds.
- `PD-RSP-07` — `safe_point` exact-restores the named worktree; `historical_commit` creates an isolated clean worktree at an exact OID; `worktree_head` binds without restore to exact HEAD plus state digest.
- `PD-RSP-08` — Assistant Chat owns immutable conversation-boundary restore points; apply means branch to a new thread/branch without changing the source thread/worktree or restoring files.
- `PD-RSP-09` — `cmd.chat.revert` uses the same FileSafe manifest, journal, rollback, equality, and outcomes as safe-point restore.

Storage plan and the storage registry/schema own safe-point/restore-transaction/restore-point persistence and keys; FileSafe owns snapshot/equality/restore mechanics; Contracts owns outcome/reason enums and event payloads; Worktree owns baseline filesystem/Git effects; Executor owns admission and attempt lineage; Assistant Chat owns restore-point lifecycle; UI Catalog/Commands/Section 15/Runtime Artifacts consume those owners.

Negative constraints: no merge under safe-point or Chat revert; no portable whole-tree atomicity claim; no `restored_clean` without target equality; no `restore_failed` without verified rollback equality; no mutation after refusal; no new legacy-key primary write; no deferred bundled row used as launch authority; no timer-only release of the last legal recovery path; no branch-name substitute for immutable OID; no restore point that mutates its source or silently restores files; and no weaker Chat restore engine.

Acceptance is governed by every `RSP-ATOMIC-*`, `RSP-EQUAL-*`, `RSP-INTEGRITY-*`, `RSP-SCOPE-*`, `RSP-RETENTION-*`, `RSP-KEY-*`, `RSP-REGISTRY-*`, `RSP-BASELINE-*`, `RSP-RP-*`, `RSP-CMD-*`, and `RSP-CHAT-*` oracle in the source plan, including target-or-rollback crash convergence, exact digest truth, key/alias closure, retention holds, baseline effects, source-preserving conversation branching, complete command registration, and Chat/FileSafe parity.

### DL-033: Case L supplemental probes — fallback divergence, restore-command normalization, and migration preflight

Approved on 2026-07-18. The approval source records the calendar date but not an exact UTC instant; this entry does not invent one. This grouped entry records exactly three accepted decision packets:

- `PD-PROBE-L011-01` — Select `A/A/A/A/A`: expose the three independently permissioned IDs `cmd.storage.fallback.keep_logical_root`, `cmd.storage.fallback.fork_new_instance`, and `cmd.storage.fallback.export_both`; require the explicit expected storage-instance, logical-root, root-generation, fallback-branch/base, logical/fallback-head SHA-256, and bootstrap-binding SHA-256 CAS fields and handler revalidation; return a candidate fork binding without changing active bootstrap selection; export an exact-byte encrypted recovery-custody package to explicit `destination_ref` with a non-secret manifest and key ref while retaining both source roots until separate cleanup; and use an owner receipt without inventing a new event family.
- `PD-PROBE-L020-01` — Select `A/A/A`: remove `retry_scope`; validate `permission_snapshot_id` against current permission state and consume it before the sole handler so the normalized payload exactly equals the canonical payload; and make the compatibility alias accept the wrapper input and apply the identical deterministic transform.
- `PD-PROBE-L032-01` — Select `A`: use `outcome = ready|blocked` with required-present `reason_code = null|blocked_insufficient_space`; `ready` pairs only with null and `free_bytes >= required_free_bytes`, while `blocked` pairs only with `blocked_insufficient_space` and `free_bytes < required_free_bytes`.

Storage plan owns fallback continuity/reconciliation and migration preflight/progress semantics. Executor owns admitted retry identity and retry semantics; Worktree Git owns the affected safe-point worktree boundary. Commands, the UI catalog, production wiring, Final GUI, Contracts, the storage registry/recovery schema, readiness, and Automated Testing consume those owners without creating a second handler, authority test, or peer policy.

Negative constraints: no fallback merge, overwrite, deletion, authority change, or silent bootstrap switch outside the selected contract; no invented `storage.fallback_reconciled` event; no retained `retry_scope`, forwarded wrapper-only field, second handler, or receipt-only/no-event peer execution path; no unlisted preflight outcome/reason, fabricated schema-valid result, ETA, or percentage; and no WorkNode or NodeSeed creation.

These three decisions authorize owner-first materialization only. They do not establish the persisted-event denominator, complete the event-family registry, close `CL-CRIT-EVENT-AUTHORITY-001`, close any Case L finding or obligation, or prove shard, gate, governance, runtime, certification, or buildability state. They do not select or record any wave-5 producer-owner discovery decision.

### DL-034: Case L supplemental kernel-depth packet choices

Approved on 2026-07-18. The approval source records the calendar date but not an exact UTC instant; this entry does not invent one. This grouped entry records exactly nine accepted decision packets:

- `DP-K37-01 A` — Close the 21 Goal and GoalRun payloads with one per-event schema per row and a shared common `$defs` base; each event schema has a const discriminator and a closed event-specific payload.
- `DP-K37-02 B` — Bind those 21 rows to a small closed owner-approved retention-class map, with every event row assigned to exactly one structured policy ref and no prefix-derived inference.
- `DP-K37-03 A` — Represent `platform.capability_evaluated` with catalog-referenced capability IDs, closed requested/effective evaluation-state enums, degradation reason, and evidence refs.
- `DP-K37-04 A` — For `restore_point.applied`, require `new_thread_id` and `new_branch_id` only for `branched`, forbid them for `refused|failed`, and use canonical `application_id`/command idempotency identity for replay.
- `DP-K37-05 A` — Use a restore-point-specific flat corruption-reason enum that distinguishes record-hash mismatch, unreadable record, corrupt referenced material, and unsupported content scope while keeping missing material on a distinct state/event path.
- `DP-K37-06 C` — Make `run.started` a hybrid: require the canonical runtime-policy snapshot ref and inline the minimum immutable requested/effective mode, overlay, strategy, provider/model/account/persona, and resolution-reason join fields needed for audit and indexing.
- `DP-K37-07 A` — Extend the canonical `cmd.runtime.*` recovery namespace for `safe_point.recovery_unavailable`, reusing registered replan/runtime actions and registering exact locate-verified-recovery and explicit-abandonment actions with typed payloads and receipts.
- `DP-K37-08 A` — Represent `storage.boot_recovery` with a closed coordinator-operation enum plus a prior-event repeat ref, distinguishing same-episode dedupe from a later boot summary that refers to the original event.
- `DP-K37-09 A` — Use dedicated flat integrity-failure and recovery-action enums derived from the Case L loss table for `storage.integrity_detected` and `storage.recovery_applied`, preserving the closed `impact_precision` boundary and preventing advisory evidence from becoming recovery authority.

Goal Runtime owns Goal and GoalRun event semantics; Storage owns retention, event persistence/registration, boot recovery, integrity, and recovery-action policy; platform/provider capability owners own capability-catalog meaning; Assistant Chat owns restore-point lifecycle; FileSafe owns restore/recovery mechanics; Run Modes, Executor, Models, and Multi-Account own requested/effective runtime selection. Contracts supplies shared envelopes/vocabulary, and the event-family registry/schema is machine authority only for rows actually materialized from those owners. Commands and GUI surfaces remain consumers of registered owner contracts.

Negative constraints: no shared open payload, generic object, wildcard/default row, inferred scope, inferred retention, or raw-secret field; no failed/refused restore target identities; no second recovery command namespace or handler; no exact wire-token spelling invented where the approved option defined only the closed model and semantic classes; no WorkNode or NodeSeed creation; and no wave-5 producer-owner discovery decision selected or recorded.

These nine decisions authorize owner-first materialization only. They do not establish the complete persisted-event denominator, make any registry row depth-complete, complete the event-family registry, close `CL-CRIT-EVENT-AUTHORITY-001`, close any Case L finding or obligation, or prove shard, gate, governance, runtime, certification, or buildability state.

This source-preserving standardization keeps the owner and consumer boundaries stated in the original document body. During this batch, `Plans/Decision_Log.md` remains the owner doc for the behavior described by its preserved sections, while cross-doc ownership follows the ContractRefs and boundary notes already present in the original text.

Original hash: `f2e60f840d40385942aad5a8875a8243bc33fcfa07959d008e3fe231cc4023f7`.

Run-scoped proof artifacts:

All original spans from `Decision_Log-S0001` through `Decision_Log-S0026` are preserved in place. Phase 2B batch 043 atomized or structurally dispositioned those spans into `DL-002` through `DL-026`, the retired `DL-001` bridge, and explicit structural coverage_map dispositions. `DL-001` is retained only as migration-lineage compatibility coverage and must not re-own atomized source coverage. This batch did not update Spec Lock, generated shards, evidence bundles, auto_decisions, or plan_graph, and it did not create WorkNodes, NodeSeeds, executable queues, final node manifests, or production build tasks.

## FABLE Deferred Action Concrete Repair Addendum - 2026-07-08

This addendum repairs non-runtime decision-log rows without creating WorkNodes, implementation files, runtime artifacts, or PNC-019 evidence.

- Repairs `sfk-f6f04565ca3fcaa8bf3a4f6d`: `DecisionRecord` fields are `decision_id`, `title`, `status`, `owner_doc_ref`, `decided_at_utc`, `supersedes[]`, `rationale_ref`, `affected_policy_axes[]`, and `gui_surface_ref?`. GUI visibility is through Settings > Governance > Decisions when surfaced by FinalGUISpec.
- Repairs `sfk-1608f2e00293837927ad2df5`: "timestamped and final" applies to the historical decision entry, not to generated PlanUnit splits. Split-recommended PlanUnits may create derived records without mutating the original decision text.

## FABLE Remaining Action Plan Audit-Lineage Notes (2026-07-08)

These rows are preserved as audit-lineage notes only. They do not prove repair by themselves; repaired status requires concrete canonical prose/schema/enum/command/algorithm evidence in this owner doc or an explicit non-repair disposition in `Plans/.audits/fable-20260706/owner_note_closure_fidelity_after.jsonl`. This note creates no WorkNodes, NodeSeeds, queues, runtime artifacts, implementation files, production build tasks, final manifests, or PNC-019 receipts, and it does not mark `buildability_gate_passed` true.

- `registry_line 341` (explicitly_deferred; source line 1152; `sfk-f6f04565ca3fcaa8bf3a4f6d`): Explicitly deferred: closing this row requires a dedicated owner-doc/schema/detail lane beyond safe non-runtime hygiene; no buildability or runtime proof is claimed here. Source summary: - [CRITICAL] whole doc: steer asks about "decision record schema/GUI" no such schema or GUI exists anywhere in the file; every DL unit is a prose decision statement with governance metadata only.
