### DL-036: Research decision packets in production — chat artifact plus one-at-a-time decision cards

Approved on 2026-09-09 by Jared in conversation, after reviewing the plain-language terminal decision sheet used for DL-035. This entry records the product behavior for bringing research and audit decisions to the user in production Puppet Master. It authorizes planning under the named owners, not implementation.

Recorded requirement, in Jared's terms:

- A decision packet produced by research or audit is handed to the user in chat as an artifact containing every item.
- Each item is then presented to the user in the chat window one at a time as a decision card built from the plain-language decision form: a plain name; the question in one sentence; why it came up; what you would get; what it costs; the options; the recommendation if there is one.
- The user answers each card with exactly one of four responses: Approve; Deny; Deny with changes, where the user states the change; Ask a question, where the question routes to research or the agent and the item is re-presented with the answer.
- While items are presented one at a time, the user can open the full artifact with all items at any time.
- The cards reuse the planned question card and questionnaire mechanism (`Plans/assistant-chat-design.md` section 7.4) modified for this purpose: more information per item than a question card, and this different, fixed set of responses. One-at-a-time sequencing is the presentation rule for this flow, not a change to the general questionnaire contract.
- Status and disposition are shown with text labels. No colored border bars or stripes as status indicators. No emoji glyphs.
- Approved, denied, denied-with-changes and pending dispositions are recorded so agents do not ask the same question again. Approval authorizes planning that feature; execution follows the existing Approve And Build path (PWIZ-010).
- The bootstrap and audit form of the same packet is a plain-language document; the production flow above is the product form.

Assistant Chat owns the artifact surface, the decision card, its responses and the question-flow reuse; Planning Wizard owns where the flow sits in a planning run and how dispositions feed topics, amendments and Approve And Build; Contracts own the typed envelope; FinalGUI owns visual presentation; Storage owns disposition persistence; UI Command Catalog and Wiring own the commands.

Negative constraints: no auto-approval, auto-denial or auto-submit on dismissal; no agent may answer a card on the user's behalf; asking a question does not consume or alter the pending decision; no colored status bars; no emoji; no implementation, WorkNodes or NodeSeeds from this record.

## Compilation scope

Use the shared questionnaire profile and artifact navigation, exact user-originated responses, independent review, standard shard/index regeneration and immediate scoped commit. No implementation, WorkNodes, NodeSeeds or governance seal. No new user decision is inferred; DL-035 terminal input-policy question is outside this ledger.
